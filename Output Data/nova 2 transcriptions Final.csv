"Mrs. Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting to the ER with chest palpitations and syncope. The symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past 2 months and have increased dramatically over the past 3 days. They happen during any activity. The patient presented with an 8 pound weight gain, swollen like syncope, palpitations, coughing, and is currently sleeping in a chair. Her previous medical problems are hypertension, controlled, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Her current medications are prednisone and Lisinopril with no known drug allergies. She does not use tobacco, illicit drugs, or alcohol. She walks on a daily basis, drink drinks 1 cup of coffee per day, and is an elementary school teacher. Her mother died from a from sudden death at age 40 and father from a myocardial infarction at 59. Her physical exam showed jugular venous distension, wheezing, and s 4 murmur, lower extremity edema. Labs and imaging support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis that has infiltrated the heart muscle. Our plan is to admit to the hospital where she will follow-up with a cardiologist and radiologist for a PET scan. We will up her dose of prednisone to 60 milligrams, add furosemide, and amiodarone. She will continue on her current Lisinopril. Thank you."
"Hi, doctor Rollins. I just saw miss Palmer in room 6. She's a 62 year old female who presents to the emergency department with a 2 month history of worsening dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and near syncope. She stated that her symptoms improved with rest. However, they were brought on by most activity, including her daily tasks. She denies any chest pain, but also reported that, some orthopnea causing her to sleep in her chair at night. She stated that she was seen in her family practice office 3 days ago where they did a 2 d echo, EKG labs, and a chest X-ray. She stated that she was instructed by her family practitioner to come to the ER due to her worsening symptoms. Her active medical conditions include hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams once daily. She reported that both medical conditions have been well controlled with her medications. She denied any allergies and reported that she had a cardiac cath about a year ago due to an abnormal EKG, but there was no coronary occlusion. She denied any prior hospitalizations and reported that she is fully immunized. She reports that her mom died suddenly at the age of 40, and her father died of a myocardial infection at age 59. She stated she has a good support system and lives at home with her spouse. And she stated that she is sexually active with her spouse and that the relationship is monogamous. She stated she has a balanced diet and used to walk daily with friends until her recent symptoms, have prevented her from continuing to do so. She denies any tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use and reported that she drinks about 1 cup of coffee in the morning and works as a 3rd grade school teacher. My physical exam showed bibasilar rails and wheezing on lung auscultation. Heart sounds were regular with a systolic murmur and s four heart sound and no carotid bruise. Her PMI was normal, but she had JVD bilaterally, and, I noted some pedal edema. Her lower extremity pulses were normal and her calves were of equal size and color and nontender to palpation, and she had a negative Homan sign. Her chest was nontender to palpation. I also evaluated anterior Chapman's points, posterior tart changes, and her, thoracic spine, and I had no osteopathic findings to report. Her chest X-ray, demonstrated mediastinal fullness with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and, a normal heart size. Her echo showed a restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and her labs revealed a normal troponin, but an elevated BNP at 4,000. Based on my findings, I believe she has sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy NYHA class 3, and I explained that I believe the pulmonary sarcoidosis has begun to infiltrate her heart as well. I recommended that we admit her to the telemetry unit and consider consult with interventional cardiology for the placement of an I AICD and consult with radiology for a possible FDG PET scan. I also recommended that we keep her on the Lisinopril, increase her prednisone dose to 60 milligrams daily, add furosemide 40 milligrams IV, and also, an amiodarone drip of 1 50 milligrams, And that is all. Thank you."
"Today with shortness of breath and, fatigue. She is 62 years old and presented to the emergency room. She said rest makes her pain or her shortness of breath better, and also sitting up in her chair and exercise makes it significantly worse. So miss Palmer is a female, and, her past medical history consists of diabetes, hypertension, as well as hyperlipidemia. She's been experiencing these symptoms for about 6 months and went to her PCP about 3 days ago. They sent her to us, and now here she is. So her, blood blister also includes diabetes. Not sure if I mentioned that. And I have my, notes in front of me. The patient has a history of a bypass surgery, and got about 5 stents beginning place. The first one was placed 20 years ago. The last recent one was placed a year ago, and she was told she can no longer receive that sort of treatment. Excuse me. She appeared well, alert, however, slightly fatigued, and she didn't have any skin lacerations, no bruising, just fatigue, shortness of breath, or achieve complaints. She had known neurological signs. Her heart was beating fast, she said, so syncope and, dyspnea and better lying down. So forethought, ma'am. And she had wheezing and rales when she came in. So the physical exam showed that she had jugular venous distension as well as the raising of the wheezing and the rales. She also had petal edema and, even pulses. She said her mother had breast cancer and her father had Alzheimer's. She, is on a handful of medications. She's on amiodarone, morfarin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, metoprolol succinate. And I had the history of the surgical procedures of the. She has no allergies. And after all the diagnosis on or all the a physical exam was done. We talked about our results together. I presented her EKG, which showed a left bundle branch block, some left ventricular hypertrophy, but normal sinus rhythm. Her, echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy, and her X-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema as well as her labs that showed elevated troponin of 0.4 and her BNP of 4,000. After this, I originally had the differential of potential heart failure, maybe some musculoskeletal chest pain because she wasn't in the best health to begin with, and, ischemic cardiomyopathy ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and that is what it ended up being. So she was advised to be admitted to the ICU and talk to an interventional cardiologist who would get her set up with an AICD and a not place another stent, but place another cardiac device. So she was being admitted on a low sodium diet with, absolutely had a total restriction to exercise. Her nursing orders were strict IO, daily weights taken, and DVT peripheral access. Yeah. Moving ahead, she will see all the specialists, be in the hospital until she's feeling better. And we did shift her medications, so she's only taking clopidogrel and warfarin and dobutamine now. And she was put on an insulin sliding scale, and she was admitted because of her diabetes as well as, given a BiPAP machine to help with her shortness of breath. And the patient also had a history of atrial fibrillation. Yep. The patient was asked if they had medical insurance, and they did. They have a pharmacy set up, and they have support at home. So they are in a good place moving forward, and I'm hopeful that they will be able to receive the care that they need and to continue on their journey to find help."
"Mister Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male, who presents with 2 weeks of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Patient also reports instances of feeling like he would pass out. He states that he is not short of breath at rest, but that even with walking short distances, he is short of breath. I think I would give him an NYHA score of class 3. He is able to lay flat and denies any recent illness. He has a history of hypertension and is on Lisinopril. His family history includes, history of sudden death in his mother and an MI myocardial myocardial infarction in his father. He reports a year ago that he had a catheter cardiac catheterization, and that was normal. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or do illicit drugs. He is a school teacher. Review of systems were a positive for fatigue, warm to the touch skin, palpitations, near syncope, wheezing, and shortness of breath. No chest pain or ortho orthopnea. Vitals were remarkable for hypotension at 80 over 50 and hypoxia at 85% on Romare. Physical exam showed systolic murmur with s four Gallup. He had a PMI, point maximal impulse, that was displaced laterally. Lungs were cleared to association. There was no calf tenderness. No lower extremity edema. PT and DP pulses were full and equal bilaterally. Labs showed a troponinbmp within normal limits. NKG showed left ventricular left ventricular hypertrophy and tel septal r waves. Echo showed thickened intraventricular septum with an EF of 60%. Patient should be admitted to telemetry due to diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiofamilial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Secondary diagnosis would be hypertension. I advise the patient that we should discontinue Lisinopril and start on disoparamide. Consult was done with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgeon for either alcohol ablation or myectomy. Patient is in agreement with plan. He was canceled on, the further plan, and he was alerted of the cause of his symptoms. Thank you."
"Good morning. Miss Palmer is a 60 year old 62 year old female presenting to us with shortness of breath. Patient states that they're physical physically active and exercise routinely, but started developing difficulty breathing when exercising. This encounter, occurred prior to our visit several weeks ago and has had a gradual onset. Patient states that they feel short of breath when exercising and describes it as it's isolated only to the chest. It is aggravated when exercising and relieved by stopping and by stopping physical activity. Patient has a prior history of cardiac catheterization and currently presents to us with a previous history of hypertension. Patient states do not have any known allergies. Patient follows a balanced diet, does not consume alcohol, tobacco, or any illicit drugs. A patient drinks coffee in the mornings and, family history consists of the mother passing away suddenly, without reason and father passing away from myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Miss Palmer is fatigued, reports presyncope palpitations and wheezing, and she is currently on lisinopril 10, milligrams once per day. Patient was alert and oriented. Physical exam found jugular venous distension, regular rate for heart rate, wheezing, and RAILs. Upon physical exam, KALF was non tender but presents lower extremity edema. Imaging found cardiomegaly and via 2 d echo demonstrates left ventricular asymmetry and hypertrophy with ejection fracture of 60%. EKG presents tall R waves and septal leads. Troponin and, BNP are within normal limits. Completion of physical exam and interview led to suspected diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patient is classified New York Heart Association 2 and is to be sent to the telemetry unit under Sears condition. Whereas every 2 hours of activity is tolerated, nursing intervention consists of strict INOs, o two via cannula and can maintain at 96%. Patients should be on DVT prophylaxis, and patient can receive a regular diet. IV orders are KBO. We discussed the plan and to discontinue Lisinopril and hold it and administer disopiramide 100 milligrams PO. No labs and images are needed. We plan to consult cardiology for AICD placement and we didn't but we did not get to discuss cardiac surgery, but should be consulted for septomyectomy. Patient was briefed and asked if she had had any questions for her care and agreed upon the treatment plan. Thank you so much."
"I am reviewing today is a 65 year old male named Leslie Palmer. He presented with shortness of breath and fatigue when exercising. He mentioned he had several episodes of near syncope. He went to his family medicine doctor where they ran multiple tests, and he was recommended to come to the ER if he kept having these symptoms. He, again, had shortness of breath near syncope. He was breathless and fatigued when he tried to exercise, and his heart was beating out of his chest. When going over his past medical history, he had hypertension, which he was on 10 milligrams of Lisinopril 4. He had a cardiac cath a year ago, due to an abnormal EKG. When discussing his family history, he mentioned his mother died suddenly at 40 years old, and his father was deceased at 59 from a myocardial infarction. When discussing his social history, he denied use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. He had a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables, protein. He went for regular walks before his shortness of breath, and he was a elementary school teacher and had a, spouse of over 30 years. He had no known drug allergies. And when reviewing the, systems, he appeared fatigue and complained of fatigue. He had no fever or chills, no weight changes, either loss or gain. No rashes, no bruises, no lesions on the skin. He findings were negative, so no headache, no stiffness of the neck, no visual or auditory difficulties. For cardiovascular, he did have those palpitations and your syncope, but no chest pain. He complained of wheezing and dyspnea, but orthopnea was okay. When discussing MSK, he had no muscle pain or joint pain and no edema in his lower extremity. He had no dizziness or confusion or gait changes. When reviewing the the labs, troponin and BNP were normal. And when looking at the chest X-ray, it displayed cardiomegaly with, no edema or infiltrates. And when looking at the echo, it was described as asymmetry because of a thickened septum. And with all of these findings, we, came to the conclusion that his hit oh, along with his vital signs being a 110 for his pulse, a 130 over 90 for his blood pressure, 96 oxygen, and respirations were around 16. After reviewing everything, we came to the conclusion that this was, familial, hokum. So hypertrophic, myocart hokum. And, when we looked at everything, we recommended seeing a cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon for septalablation or some other sort of surgery, with to treat the septum, including the, AICD placement from the cardiologist. This was the conclusion of this patient."
"Today, I saw doctor or mister Leslie Palmer. He's a 62 year old male. He came in complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue, and has been progressing throughout the last 6 months with the last 3 days getting gradually worse, and very severe today. He came to the emergency department at the recommendation of his primary care physician who suggested that he come. He is having dyspnea even at rest and has to sleep upright, so orthopnea as well. Past medical history, pertinent for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Diabetes for the last 15 years, atrial fib for the past 5. His surgical history is positive for a coronary artery bypass graft and 5 cardiac stents. He has maxed out on stents and the cardiologist indicated no further intervention. Family history for maternal, his mom has breast cancer and his dad, maternal, has Alzheimer's, but he is still alive. As far as social history, it is positive for tobacco use. He is a smoker for the past 30 years. No alcohol, no drugs. He is employed and has a regular balanced diet, and he used to exercise but is now unable to due to the shortness of breath and fatigue, and he lives with his spouse, his wife. Current medications, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, once a day. That atorvastatin was once a day. Furosemide, 20 milligrams, twice a day. Metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams, once a day. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. Metformin, 500, twice a day, and warfarin, 2.5 milligram, twice a day. He is compliant in all those medications. No known drug allergies. His review his review of symptoms is, positive for fatigue, weight gain, shortness of breath, so the dyspnea, the orthopnea. He also has positive wheezing and lower extremity edema. He is awake and alert and oriented times 4, but he is fatigued. Vitals today, temperature, 98 point 6 normal, heart rate 90 normal, respiratory rate 22, so a bit of tachypnea, rest or blood pressure 80 over 50, so very low blood blood pressure, and oxygen saturation 86%, so low. Jugular venous dissension was present on physical exam, but there were no carotid breweries. On auscultating his heart, I did hear a gallop, but no murmur, no friction rub, and he did have tachycardia with a PMI, pulse of maximal impulse, displaced laterally. Lungs, were positive for rales and wheezing, but no chest wall tenderness. As far as his lower extremities, I did also take or I did check his pulses. Those were full and equal. He did have some pedal edema, but his calves were nontender and human sign negative. Imaging, we had a chest x-ray results with cardiomegalypulmonary edema, 2 d echo with indicated dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction less than 30. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, but left bundle branch block, and his lab's troponin was elevated at 0.04, and BNP was elevated at 4,000. So I indicated that he's diagnosed with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. I did explain this to the patient. His New York Heart Association classification is 4 as he is unable to carry on physical activity even at rest. His disposition, we should admit him to the ICU in serious condition, check his vitals every 2 hours. I think he should be on strict bed rest, and the nurses should check strict ins and outs, daily weight, and check for DVT prophylaxis. I recommend a sodium low sodium diet, and if we indicate fluids we should keep his vein open for now. As far as medication changes, I would like to continue his warfarin and his clopidogrel, change all his other ones, add on disopyramide 100 milligrams once a day, and change that metformin to an insulin sliding scale. Since his oxygen saturation is so low at 86, I would like to place him on BiPAP and order the lab's serotriponin and PTINR. For consultation, I'd like to consult interventional cardiology so that they can check for if he is a candidate for a pacemaker, either AICD or CRT. Other than that, we should get Mr. Palmer into the ICU and see if we can help, get his shortness of breath and fatigue figured out and get that oxygen saturation much higher. Alright, thank you."
"I met, mister Leslie Palmer who's a 62 year old male, in presenting with episodic chest pain. Sorry. Episodic near syncope associated with light headedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling raspy and wheezing for the past 2 weeks. He says symptoms get better with rest and describes it as severe in nature. Episodes last 30 to 45 minutes. He denies any prior history of this, and says this is new, in the past 2 weeks. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, and he's currently on 10 milligrams of Lisinopril for that, once a day. He has a history of a cardiac catheterization that came back normal. His family history was significant for his mother passing away at 40 from sudden what was predisposed to be sudden cardiac death. His father passed away at 69 from an MI. His review of systems was positive for, fatigue, lightheadedness, near syncope, palpitations, wheezing, and dyspnea. He denied any fever, chills, weight changes, skin changes, any myalgias, joint pain, chest pain, orthopnea, no neck swelling, trouble swallowing, or anything of that nature. His vitals, his heart rate was elevated at 110. Otherwise, his vitals were normal. His oxygen was 96%. His respiratory rate was, 16, blood pressure, 130 over 90, and his temperature was 98.6. On exam, well, he had positive JVD. His cardiovascular exam was regular rate. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. His PMI was displaced laterally, and we noted bibasilar rails and wheezing present. He had plus 1 pitting lower extremity edema, but otherwise full DPPT pulses, no calf tenderness or home inside. My assessment is that the patient was awake, fatigued, and oriented. And then going through his results, his chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, otherwise normal. 2 d echo showed left ventricular asymmetry, with hypertrophy, EF of 60%. His EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 60. That was the rate with normal access, LVH criteria, and peak r waves in septal leads. His troponin and BNP were both normal, and with this information, I diagnosed the patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I gave him a class 2, New York Heart Association, and I gave him a secondary diagnosis of hypertension. I decided to admit him to telemetry. His condition was serious at the time of admission. I ordered vitals every 2 hours and activity as tolerated. For nursing orders, I added in a strict IO, daily weight, oxygen via nasal cannula, 2 liters per minute, to maintain that sat of 96% or greater, in addition to DVT prophylaxis. For diet, I ordered regular diet for him and then to keep the vein open for IV. And then as far as his medications goes, I asked him to discontinue the Lisinopril, and start the disopyramide at a 100 milligrams PO. And for consults for this patient, I, requested he be seen by interventional cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery, for potential AICD placement, septomyomectomy, and alcohol injection. And that is all I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time."
"The pleasure of seeing Leslie Palmer, a 62 year old female in the emergency department today. She complained of shortness of breath and fatigue for the last 2 months, with intermittent episodes of palpitations and feeling like she may pass out. She has orthopnea and must sleep in her recliner. She is limited in her ability to walk with her neighbors due to her symptoms. Her symptoms are relieved by rest. She is currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams daily to treat hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis respectively. She was diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She has no known drug allergies. 1 year ago, she underwent heart underwent heart catheterization, which was negative, and she denies other surgeries or hospitalizations. Her family history is pertinent for a father who passed away at age 59 from a myocardial infarction and a mother who passed away unexpectedly at age 40 likely due to sudden cardiac death. She has a sister who has no medical conditions and is living. She eats a well balanced diet, does not use illicit drugs, tobacco products, or alcohol. She consumes 1 cup of coffee a day. She is an elementary school teacher. She lives at home with her husband. She has no children. She used to regularly walk with her neighbors before the onset of these symptoms. She denies fever, chills, or weight loss, but endorses fatigue in an 8 pound weight gain over the last 2 weeks. She denies any skin changes such as rash, bruising, lacerations. She denies any changes in her vision, changes in hearing, difficulty swallowing, or headaches. She denies any gait disturbances or dizziness. She endorses lower extremity edema, but denies joint or muscle pain. She denies chest pain, but endorses palpitations and presyncopal sensations. She denies any syncopal episodes. She endorses shortness of breath, orthopnea, and wheezing. She denies cough. Vital signs reveal that she is tachycardic at a 110 beats per minute, hypertensive at 136 over 99, tikypneic at 20 respirations a minute. She is afebrile, and she is hypoxemic at 91%. Physical exam revealed, venous jugular venous distension. Pardon me. No carotid buries. She has a regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur in s four gallop. Pulmonary auscultation reveals bilateral rails. Lower edemity, pardon me. Lower extremity plus 1 petting edema is noted, and normal pedal pulses are present. There is also no calf pain. Labs showed normal troponin levels and an elevated BNP at 4,000. Chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema and pawnbroker signs suggestive of sarcoidosis. Echocardiogram showed nondilated ventricles with an increased ventricular wall thickness with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a 100 beats per minute, normal access access with less than 30 second nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Given her history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, I suspect she is having a restrictive cardiomyopathy due to cardiac infiltration of the sarcoidosis. She has a New York Heart Association class 3. Secondary diagnoses include hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. I am admitting her to telemetry. I am continuing her Lisinopril. I will be adding amiodarone a 150 milligrams IV, increasing prednisone to 60 milligrams, and adding furosemide 40 milligrams IV. I will order CNP Labs and refer to interventional cardiology for an AICD placement and radiology for an FDG PET scan. Thank you."
"62 year old female presents with complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She was afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 110, o two stats of 91, which was low, pulse of 110, blood pressure, 130 over 90, and respiratory rate of 20. Patient had previous viral infection approximately 2 weeks ago, and has continued to have heart palpitations, substernal dull chest pain, orthopnea, dyspnea, and shortness of breath at rest. Previous history positive for high blood pressure and currently takes 10 milligrams of Lisinopril once daily. Patient had previous visit to their PCP and they refer them to the ED for their symptoms. Patient has had muscle aches, joint pain, and weight gain of £8 in the past 2 week. NYHA score 4 since they have experienced symptoms at rest. Physical exam was positive for JVD, but no carotid bluey bruise, regular heart sounds with no murmurs. PMI was displaced laterally, but the chest wall was not tender. Bilateral rails and wheezing were auscultated. Lower extremity pitting edema was found, but both pulses, DP and PT, were strong bilaterally. No calf tenderness was noted on physical exam. Negative family history for cardiac if you issues. Father is currently living with Alzheimer's in a home facility, and the mother died of breast cancer at age 89. Patient does not use alcohol, tobacco products, but does drink one cup of coffee daily. They have a regular balanced diet and exercise consistently about 3 times a week. They have no known drug allergies and history of a cardiac cath 1 year ago. The troponin was elevated at 0.1 and BNP was elevated at 4,000. Chest x-ray was positive for pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%. EKG was positive for PVCs, right bundle branch block, left axis, and sinus tach. This is consistent with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient will be admitted to telemetry, vitals, Q2 hours and activity is tolerated. Nursing orders to monitor ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, prophylaxis, and start on o two nasal cannula to maintain o two stats above 96%. Diet is low sodium and fluid restriction. Keeping patient on Lisinopril adding 625 milligrams acetaminophen by mouth, q two q six hours, and furosemide, 40 milligrams IV. I ordered seriotroponins, a CMP, and a repeat 2 d echo. I also put in consults to interventional cardiology for AICD and CRTD placement, and cardiac biopsy. Another consult to infectious disease for immune globulin and glucocorticoids and a consult to radiology for a media enhanced MRI to detect inflammation of the heart. Patient is expected to be admitted and discharged. They were instructed to maintain a healthy weight and healthy lifestyle once discharged, and activity once cleared by a cardiologist."
"Mister Leslie Palmer, he's a 62 year old male, presents to the ED with shortness of breath and fatigue. 2 weeks ago, he was walking with his buddy. He began to feel shortness breath, felt tired, and felt like he was ready to pass out. He felt concerned about that because every time he exercise, he feel like he's ready to pass out, got really tired. He saw his family medicine doctor 3 days ago, and it was they told him to get if it got worse, to go to the emergency room, and that's why he's here. He's learning on times 4. He is fatigued right now. His vital signs, his heart rate was 110, a little high, and his, pulse ox was 96%. His temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Now with the HPI and review systems, he had no chest pain. He did have palpitations, but it got worse with activity and exercise, but it did it got better with rest and he was negative for orthopnea. Past medical history, he had hypertension. He had a cardiac cath 1 year ago due to an abnormal EKG, but the results were normal. Now his family medical history, his mother had a sudden cardiac or sudden cardiac death. His father passed away of a myocardial infarction. She passed his mother passed away at age 40. His medications right now, he's on Lisinopril 10 milligrams, once a day. He has no drug allergy. Social history was negative for anything pertinent. His elementary school teacher, he does use moderate amount of caffeine and he used to exercise and was active, but he can't right now because of the fatigue. He has a well balanced diet and he's married. Now review systems, he was positive for t palpitations, he was negative for chest pain, and he had he was positive for presyncope episodes. He did have dyspnea. He was positive for wheezing. He was negative for hear head, ears, eyes, neck, and throat. Negative for skin, negative for musculoskeletal, and negative for neuro. On physical exam, he did not have any jugular vein distension nor bruise, but he did have a heart murmur with an s four heart sound gallop. And his lungs were clear bilaterally and equal and no lower extremity edema, no, deep vein thrombosis as well. Negative Hohman sign. His x-ray showed cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema. Echo showed asymmetric hypertrophy with ejection fraction about 60% showing that there's some hypertrophy going on. EKG had tall r wave in the septal leads and normal sinus with left ventricular hypertrophic criteria, and labs are normal with the EKG echo x-ray. This was leading me towards familial cardio familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with, stage 2 NYHA 2 class heart failure. So we are gonna I was what we can run this over, but thinking of admitting him telemetry, vitals every 2 hours, ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis, daily weight, put them on to oxygen because that pulse ox was a little low. Put them around 2 liters, keep it above 96%. He's serious, we're gonna have an activity as tolerated though, and we're gonna keep that vein open. We're not we're not gonna do any fluids right now because it's, some type of heart failure. We don't need to do that right now. Now we're gonna keep them on regular diet. We're gonna discontinue that lisinopril and put them on disapirimatil. Sorry about that. A 100 milligrams, 4 times a day. Make sure he doesn't have any antiarrhythmias. I did consult interventional cardiology for an automatic internal cardiac defibrillator to make sure that's pumping well and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myectomy and alcohol injection. Now, sir, I hope you have a great day, and this was mister Leslie Palmer, great guy. You have a good day."
"I have miss Leslie Palmer. She's a 62 year old patient who comes in with a, chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that she went to a family medicine clinic, 3 days, 3 days ago where she had some test ordered, and she, the results are here in the ER. She presents to the ER after having worsening of her symptoms. She states her symptoms began 2 months ago where she had episodes of shortness of breath. She had a fluttering heart, so she endorsed palpitations. And during these episodes, it felt like she was going to pass out. These episodes were short in nature, but they worsened with activity, but they weren't present at rest. And she said that she was sleeping in a chair, and that improved her symptoms. She has a, surgical history of a catheter, a cardiac cath. She has a medical history of hypertension, and and 25 years ago, she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. She denies any allergies at all. She states that she consumes a balanced diet, and she can no longer exercise due to her symptoms. And she denies, any alcohol use, any tobacco use, any drug use. She says she drinks one cup of coffee coffee a day. She's an elementary school teacher. She says she's sexually active with a male partner, and who she's currently living with. And, she states that her, she has no recent hospitalizations, and she says that her father died from a myocardial infarction at 59 years old, and her mother died suddenly at 40 years old. She is compliant with her Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily, and she's also taking prednisone 10 milligrams for her, sarcoidosis. She states that she's up to date on her vaccinations as well. For her review of systems, it was, negative for weight loss, but she did have £10 of weight gain. She endorses, fee, fatigue. She denies any fever or chills. She states that, skin findings were negative. There was no head and neck findings significant. She states that she, she she doesn't have any chest pain at all, but she does have palpitations. She does have that pre syncope that I discussed. She denies any cough or wheezing, but she does endorse, some dyspnea and orthopium. She endorses right leg swelling as well. She denies any muscle pain or any back pain or any joint pain. She there was no, neuro findings, so no dizziness, no changes to her gait, and she no no confusion at all. Her vital signs were, she had a, SPO 2 of 91%, respiratory rate of 20, heart rate 110, temperature 98.6, and a BP of 136 over 99, and she was alert oriented, and she was, awake and fatigued as well. On physical examination, she had JVD and no brews new no bruise. Her heart rate was regular, and her systolic she had a systolic murmur, with an s 4, but she had no rubs or gallops. Her PMI was in a normal position. There was no chest wall tenderness. Her lungs, were present with, bibasilar rails and wheezing. She had one plus pitting edema on her lower extremities. She had dorsalospetus and posterior tibialis pulses were full. No tender tenderness in the calf, and her home inside was negative bilaterally as well. She had no tissue texture changes on, thoracic spine screening, and no re red reflexes, no, somatic dysfunction, no on the thoracic region as well, and no anterior Chapman points, positive. Chest x-ray presented with pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, normal cardiac silhouette, and her two d echo presented with restrictive cardiac myopathy with increased wall thickness of, 55 and ejection fraction of 55%. Her her EKG presented with normal sinus rhythm with nonsustained VTech, And her CBC, CMP were negative. PTINR were negative. Her troponins were negative, but her BMP was elevated at 4,000. And I I believe that she has class, 3 New York Heart Association Heart Failure with a history of, pulmonary sarco sarcoidosis and hypertension. So our plan is to admit her to telemetry. We're going to, we're going so she's in serious condition. We're gonna get vitals every 2 hours. She is allowed to get out of bed with assistance. We're gonna get daily IOs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis. We're going to get, give her some o, o two via nasal cannula. We're gonna, maintain her o two set at, more than 96%. She she's gonna be placed on a low sodium diet on a site a saline walk. We're gonna continue Lisinopril 10 milligrams in amiodar, and we're gonna put her on amiodar on 150 IV, up her, prednisone to 60 milligrams daily, and add furosemide 40 milligrams to diuresir. We're gonna get a repeat CMP, and we're going to send her to interventional cardiology for AICD placement, and we're going to send her to a nuclear med or radiologist for an FPGA PET scan. So, thank you very much. It was great. It was a pleasure to see this patient."
"Mister Palmer presented to the ER. He is a 62 year old white male, and he presented to the ER with complaints. 2 weeks ago, he noticed he was having dyspnea and fatigue, when he was going on his daily walk with his his friends. And that typically doesn't happen. And since those 2 weeks, he's noticed it's gotten worse. And particularly this morning, what made him came into the ER was that his this meal was so bad that his wife brought him into the ER. He didn't have any pain, and he did say that one of the leading factors is that when he rests, the shortness of breath gets better, and the dissipation gets better. He hasn't tried any treatments. He just described it as regular severity. And, really, the only complaint he came in was with shortness of breath and fatigue. Looking into some relevant history, he does have a history of hypertension, which he takes Lisinopril 4, which he was taking Lisinopril 4 regularly. He also, on his family side, his mother had died of a sudden cardiac, event. His father had passed away from an MI, age 59. His past surgical histories, he had a cardiac cath put in. But other than that, no other hospitalizations, no other relevant history. He's not a smoker. He doesn't take any illicit drug use. Doesn't drink. He has, like, the moderate cup of coffee a day. Before this, he did say he was pretty active regularly. It was just now with the shortness of breath and fatigue, he can't exercise as much as he he used to be able to. So then I conducted a physical exam, examining cardiac and pulmonary systems. When listening to his hearts, I did notice a positive systolic murmur and s four gallop. I also noticed that his PMI was laterally displaced. However, everything else was normal. I didn't hear any rales or anything. Lung sounded good. Found nothing in the OMT screen. Oh, along with dyspnea, he did mention wheezing that he would occasionally have. His vitals, when I had examined them, the heart rate was particularly high. It was at a heart rate of a 110. His blood pressure was normal, and his oxygen was normal. But I told him out that we would be concerned about that heart rate being particularly high. And then I moved on to review labs and imaging with him. So his troponin and his BNP BNP were normal. All his blood work labs were normal. His X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His, EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy. I mean, sorry. His echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy and so did his EKG with tall r septal waves. And with that finding and the phytoplasm findings and his family medical history, we came up with the diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So I told him that we would be admitting him to telemetry unit, along with changing his Lisinopril, like, stopping Lisinopril and putting him on disoparamide. And that he would be able to get out of bed as needed, but we would have, you know, his vital strep every 2 hours. We'd give him a couple standard nursing regulations, like, o two nasal cannula, DVT prophylaxis, all of those. And, I did let him know that we'd refer him to an interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement along with, potentially referring him to a cardiothoracic surgeon since he does likely have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to see if we can get either a myectomy done or some alcohol inventions to help, relieve some of that left ventricular outflow obstruction. I asked him if he had any family or friends in the area. His wife brought him in, so I let her know that we were gonna admit him and if she could bring, you know, some stuff that he would need and, if they need any any support other than that."
"Mister Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old male who presents to the emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue for the past 2 weeks. The patient reports worsening of symptoms with exertion and also experiences palpitations and shortness of breath with activity. He states that at times he feels light headed and like he might pass out but denies any syncopal episodes. He reports the symptoms improve with rest and denies chest pain. The patient went to his primary care doctor today for the worsening symptoms, where they did diagnostic testing and sent him to the emergency department for further evaluation. The patient has a medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. His immunizations are up to date. And he has no previous hospitalizations. He had a heart catheterization 10 years ago, which was normal. His mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40, and his father passed away from an IMI at 59. He denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. He has a balanced diet with regular exercise. He's an elementary school teacher and lives with his wife. He takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily for his blood pressure, and he has no known drug allergies. Review of systems was positive for fatigue, generalized weakness, presyncope, and palpitations, shortness of breath. He denied fever, chills, weight changes, bruising, lesions, rashes, weakness, sensory changes, headaches, changes in vision, neck stiffness, hearing changes, and chest pain. Vital signs, his heart rate was 110, 96 percent oxygen saturation on room air, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 98.6, and blood pressure of 130 over 90. He was awake alert oriented and no acute distress. He's well developed, well nourished male. He had no JVDs, no carotid bruit, no chest wall tenderness, and no epigastric bruit or tenderness, normal posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, negative Hohmann sign, no lower extremity edema or calf tenderness. He had a normal rhythm systolic murmur with an S4. And the PMI was displaced laterally. The lungs were clear to auscultation. And he had no chart changes. For his labs, his troponin and BNP were both within normal limits. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. And his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis, LVH voltage criteria, and tall R waves in the septal leads. So for this patient, we're going to admit him to telemetry for the diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class II, and a secondary diagnosis of hypertension. His condition is serious and will be getting vitals every 2 hours. He has no known drug allergies. Activity is tolerated. We'll put him on a regular diet and have DVT prophylaxis and an O2 oxygen nasal cannula as needed to maintain a saturation of greater than 96%. We'll put in an IV fluid saline lock, discontinue nolasinopril, and start desopyrimide 100 milligrams, 4 times a day. We don't need any other labs or imaging at this point. We will consult with interventional cardiology for potential AICD placement. And we'll also consult cardiothoracic surgery for possible septomyectomy or alcohol injection. We discussed the plan of care with the patient. He denied any other questions. And he understood and agreed with the plan of care. The patient has insurance and lives with his wife, who is his support system."
"62 year old female by the name of Leslie Palmer. She is presenting to us today with a chief complaint of dull, constant chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and wheezing for the last 2 weeks. Of note, patient does endorse having flu like symptoms about 2 weeks ago and endorsed, experiencing a fever, cough, and run over at the time, which has since resolved. However, the dull chest pain and shortness that she felt during the flu is still present, which is why she is with us today. Of note, she has been experiencing palpitations, myalgia, joint pain, breathlessness, and fatigue with activity. Miss Palmer is normally active twice a week, but lately has been unable to exercise due to fatigue and shortness of breath. She also endorses, orthopnea and must, quote, sleep, see, sleep sitting up in a chair every night, end quote. She has a history of hypertension and takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral every day consistently. She has no known drug allergies, no illicit drug use, alcohol, or tobacco use. No patient did specify that she had a cardiac cath conducted 1 year ago during her annual physical, which yielded no significant findings. No other hospitalizations and her murder her maternal family history includes a mother who died of breast cancer and a father who has Alzheimer's and is currently living in a nursing facility. Her support system at home is a husband and she works as a elementary school teacher. She denies any dizziness, confusion, syncope, headache, back pain, or neck pain. Her vitals include a temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, heart rate at 110, respirations 20, blood pressure 130 over 90, and OT stats at 91% on room air, which I placed on her on, 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen supplemental to help her breathe. Her heart rate and respirations are consistent with her, palpitations. During her physical exam, I did hear some bilateral basilar rails and wheezing as well as noticed some JVD in her neck and one plus pitting edema in her lower extremities. Her heart was regular and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No rashes, no no gluorrhinity, and she had no abdominal or carotid bruits. No calf tenderness, negative homing sign, and carotid and and, dorsalospetus her carotid and dorsalospetus pulses were present, 2 plus equal and bilateral. Her, lab's imaging included an elevated troponin of 0.1, and BNP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed a flatness of her long vessels and curly b lines consistent with pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema, as well as cardiomegaly due to an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Her 2 d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30%. Her EKG showed sinus tech with a right bundle bench block, left axis, and a PFC and a p, PVC. Due to her presentation and diagnostic imaging today, I believe that she would be she should be admitted to telemetry with a diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and is a class 2 on the NYH scale for heart failure. Secondary diagnosis is, hypertension. I consulted interventional cardiology for AICD and CRTD pacemaker assessment and radiology for a contrast MRI. If there was any encounter, I did not get the chance to, but I would also like to would have liked to consult infectious disease for a consideration for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids for treatment of management. I also ordered a diagnostic serial troponin, CNP test, and a repeat to to the echo. I also would have liked to, oh, I I also, like would like to order a Lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral, Tylenol 6 125 milligrams for oral every 6 hours for her pain, and furosemide 10 milligrams IV to reduce her edema and heart strain. To also reduce, the stress on her heart, I would also like to order a low sodium diet and oral fluid restriction to maintain our o two stats above 96%, via nasal cannula. Patient was understanding to the plan and agreed to the service, and she was advised to, continue her, balanced food diet and physical and increase our physical activity or, sorry, take it easy on our physical activity. Thank you."
"Complaint with a complaint of, shortness of breath and fatigue. He said this happened while he was exercising. He was on a walk, and he just, out of nowhere, got short of breath. This happened about 2 weeks ago. Just got really out of breath, and, proceeded to almost pass out. Felt like he was going to pass out. His past medical history is that he was he's he has hypertension. He has a cardiac calf. His past his, family history is that his mother died of sudden death, and his father died of an MI. I think his, his mother was 40 and his dad was 59. His sister is fine, though. So that heart cath and, he had he had an EKG and a heart cath, those were both about a year ago. His social history is he doesn't use alcohol. He doesn't use tobacco. He doesn't use illicit drugs. He is an elementary school teacher. He eats a balanced diet, and, he drinks a couple cup cups of coffee a day, exercises, as often as he can. He said, usually walks every day, but for the past 2 weeks, hasn't been able to because of the shortness of breath that he's been having. He lives with his wife as well. His previous medication that he was on was lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral. He has no known drug allergies. His review of systems is that he has fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, wheezing, and dyspnea. Patient on, initial, examination was awake and aware and oriented. His heart rate was a little his heart rate was 90. Respiratory rate was 22. So, very slightly, tachypnek. And, his blood pressure, he was hypotensive. It was 80 over 50, I believe. And o two level was 86%. So we, on physical examination, we had no carotid bruise, no JVD. Let's see. No JVD, regulatory regular, heart rate. Murmur was present with an s 4, and a, a systolic murmur was present with s 4 in a gallop. His PMI was normal. He was clear his respiratory area was clear to auscultation. Nothing, obvious in there. His calves were nontender. He had no pedal edema. He had no a negative Hohmann's sign, and all of his peripheral pulses were full and equal. His chest X-ray appeared, to have cardiomegaly, and it was kinda iffy, but I, said that he had pulmonary edema. It just was a little cloudy in there, not incredibly obvious, but a little cloudy. His 2 d echo said that he had left his left ventricle was asymmetric and hypertrophic with a with an EF value of 60%. His EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria and total r waves and septal waves, really pointing to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His, troponins were within normal. They were 0. His BMP was less than 100, which is within normal. His, level of dyspnea was a, I said it was NYHA score of, 3 because, he said he really struggled to breathe when he would just walk on on very slight, slight things. So he has a marked limitation of physical activity. Patients, I had decided it would be a quality idea to admit to telemetry. Patient's condition was serious. Ordered vitals for every 2 hours in activity with assistance. Nursing interventions, all kind of, generalized and normal strict IO. 02, 2 liters per, minute via nasal cannula. Maintain o two stack greater than 96%. DVT prophylaxis, diet regular because he doesn't have anything that, really indicated otherwise. And, IV fluids were just, keep vein open. No, no pain medicine. We changed his Lisinopril to DesapiroMD, 100 milligrams per oral. Everything else, I believe, was negative. We just gave him none. His inpatient consultation that I recommended was interventional cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. Interventional cardiology specifically for a an AICD so that just in case his heart were to, suddenly stop, we can we can restart it. We can get him over to the hospital. And, cardiothoracic surgery, we I, suggested a septomyectomy and or a, alcohol, ablation as those would effectively reduce his, primary issue, that being his septal hypertrophy, which was, present on the 2 d echo."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting to the emergency department with fatigue, heart palpitations, and dyspnea, both exertionally and at rest. Patients stated that she had been experiencing symptoms for around 2 months with gradual worsening and was instructed to go to the ED as per her primary care provider. Patient denies any chest pain or any other pain. Patient is a well developed, well nourished, 62 year old female, in no immediate distress upon entering exam room. Patient states she has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis, reports cardiac catheterization 1 year ago with no major complications. Patient reports, that her father died due to myocardial infarction at 59 years old that her mother died at age 40 from unknown causes. Patient's medications include Lisinopril at 10 milligrams once daily and prednisone 10 milligrams once daily. There are no known drug allergies. Patient needs a balanced diet, no alcohol, drug, or tobacco use with moderate caffeine consumption. Patient states that she used to walk regularly but cannot anymore due to her symptoms. Patient is a elementary school teacher and is in a monogamous sexually active relationship. Her vitals are as follows. Heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136 over 99, respiratory rate of 20. She is satin 90 1 on room air, and her temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Review system shows fatigue, unexplained weight gain, leg edema, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea as well as orthopnea. Physical findings show jugular vein extension but no carotid bruise. Patient does have a systolic murmur with an s 4, no regurgitation with PMI displaced laterally. Bibasilar rails can be heard on lung auscultation. Peripheral leg edema is noted. Patient is negative for Holman sign. Chest x-ray shows hilar lymphadenopathy, but no pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. 2 d echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. EKG shows sinus rhythm, normal axis with a brief period of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Lab findings include negative troponin and a BNP of 4,000. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure, but the most likely diagnosis is restrictive cardiomyopathy, second to sarcoidosis, given patient's history of sarcoidosis, sarcoidosis, and imaging findings showing hyal lymphadenopathy and restricted cardiomyopathy on the echo. Patient was admitted to telemetry, with activity out of bed with assistance and nursing instructions to be given as follows. Strict monitoring of intakes and outputs, daily weight checks, DVT prophylaxis, and o two therapy via nasal cannula with goal of maintaining oxygen saturation at 96%. Patient is also placed on a low sodium diet, and saline lock is initiated. Patient is to be continued on Lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily, but the prednisone will be increased to 60 milligrams once daily. And amiodarone 150 milligrams IV as well as furosemide 40 milligrams IV should be started. Complete metabolic panel was ordered, and a consult will be made to interventional cardiology for consult for implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator or an ACD, as well as a consult to nuclear medicine for an FDG."
"A 62 year old patient male patient presented to the clinic today with shortness of breath and fatigue. In the history of the illness, the patient stated that the that he was on a track on a run or on a walk and then experienced a shortness of breath and, fatigue as well as palpitations while he was walking his with his friends. The patient mentioned that, there was, that he experienced palpitations within the next 20 minutes upon the onset of the shortness of breath. This event occurred a couple weeks ago and has not improved ever since. And the patient's shortness of breath and palpitations as well as fatigue exacerbated with physical activity. In terms of the review systems, patient experienced fatigue, no cough, fever, malaise, or any kind of, illness or any kind of cold like symptoms, but experienced weight gain, for the past couple of weeks. Patient mentioned that there was, palpitations, but no chest pain. Along with the, palpitations, patient experienced, dyspnea and, raspy breathing. In terms of the past medical history, the patient, has a history of receiving a cardiac catheterization in an outpatient clinic. Medical history wise, patient, has been diagnosed with hypertension, no known, allergies. In terms of the social history, the patient's on balanced diet, tries to exercise regularly, doesn't take illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol, drinks one one cup of coffee every day. Patient is also a teacher, so is currently employed. Patient has been sexually active with, his significant other, but hasn't tried ever since the onset of symptoms. The patient has no hospitalizations. And in terms of family history, the patient, the patient's mother experienced a sudden death in the family. And his father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 69 and unfortunately died, from that patient's medication. The patient is on lisinopril, 10 milligrams, QID. In terms of the physical history, the patient tested positive for, jugular venous distension, but had no carotid, bruise bruise. In terms of the heart auscultations, they were regular. There was no murmur, frictional rub, or gallop. The PMI was displaced laterally, and, there was no chest wall tenderness. In terms of the Chapman point, there was no, such, there were no positive Chapman, points. For the lungs, the patient had a bibacillary rate and, experienced wheezing in the upper quadrant, in the superior lobes. For the m for MSK or, physical exam, there was a nontendored calf, with pitting edema of lower of the lower extremities, but the pulse, the drosales pedis, and the posterior tibialis, pulses were present and symmetric. In terms of the vitals, the patient, the only abnormal vital was, the heart rate, which was a 110 beats per minute. All the other vitals, temperature being 98.6, blood pressure was on 1 30 over 90. The pulse ox was 96%, and the respiratory rate was 16, beats was 16 per minute. All those were all those others were normal. In terms of diagnostic imaging, the patient the patient had cardiomegaly in the chest X-ray. The 2 d echo revealed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy, and that's because of an increased interventricular septum as well as an enlarged length left ventricle, left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute, with an abnormally tall r wave in the septal leads, particularly in v 1, v 2, and v 3. This suggests the interventricular septal septal hypertrophy due to a large entry or voltage, and that suggests that there's a this fits the LVH voltage criteria. The labs were unremarkable in in terms of everything being normal. So, troponin levels were normal. BNP was normal. CBC and CNP were normal. I proceeded with the, EMR, and the consult. So I diagnosed the patient as familial hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, explained that the disease in which the this was a disease in which the heart muscle became thickened, which makes it harder for the heart muscle to pump blood. And because it's so thick, it'll cause abnormalities in the electrical conduction. In terms of the New York Heart Association, the classification was, 2 because of the fact that, with slight limit there's slight limitation of physical activity, even though the patient was was comfortable during, rest. He mentioned that the physical activity resulted in fatigue, palpitation, and, shortness of breath, which is why it led me to believe that it was NYHA classification of 2. For the EMR for the EMR treatment plan and counseling, I admitted I told the patient that he was going to be admitted to telemetry because it was a serious condition, with q two vitals, activity as tolerated. Nursing interactions include INO daily daily weight, obtaining, daily weight measurement, DVT prophylaxis, and the patient would be on, 2 liters of, 2 liters per minute, on the nasal cannula to make sure that the pulse ox was above 96%. Diet was, I instructed the patient to be on a regular diet. IV fluids wise, it would be KVO. In terms of medications, I instructed the patient to be discontinued on, Lisinopril, but started on, disopramid with a 100 milligrams, QID. There is no diagnostic labs or imaging required. I did mention to repeat an EKG reading once at the hospital just to make sure that there was, no repeat of the of the tall, just to make sure that there was not, just to track the tall r waves, if there was any, future, EKG abnormalities. In terms of special specialist or consults, instructed the patient to visit to have, an interventional cardiology visit them for an AICD placement and, cardiothoracic surgery to visit, for septomyo myomectomy or, alcohol injection to reduce the LVOT."
"Okay. So the patient that presented to me today was Leslie Palmer. She's a 62 year old female. She was alert, awake, fatigued, and oriented. But her vital signs showed that her heart rate was 90. Her blood pressure was 80 over 50. Respiratory rate was 22. 02 sat was 86, and her temperature was 98.6. Her chief complaint was shortness of breath and fatigue at rest. Her, she described, progressively worsening shortness of breath over the last 6 months. Her shortness of breath was noted, while lying down at rest and physically and when physically active. She noted that she had started she began sleeping, in a chair at night to relieve her shortness of breath when sleeping. Her past medical history was pertinent for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, as well as, atrial fibrillation diagnosed 5 years ago. Her medications include, at the time of presentation, her medications included metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams, Lisinopril 10 milligrams, metorvastatin, 10 milligrams, metformin, 500 milligrams, furosemide, 20 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, and warfarin at 2.5 milligrams. Her surgical history shows a coronary artery bypass grafting as well as, 5 drug eluting stents within the last year. Family history showed that her father, is alive at 89 years old, but, does have Alzheimer's disease. Her mother is deceased, deceased at 80 years old due to breast cancer. Social history shows that she follows a balanced diet, moderate exercise, no illicit drug use. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes for per day for the last 30 years. She does not drink alcohol. She has matter moderate, caffeine consumption. She's employed, and she does have a social support system. So her general review system shows that she, has, claimed that she has fatigue and an 8 pound weight gain over the last couple weeks. In addition, so her skin was negative for any bruises, rashes, or anything of the sort. Her head and neck exam, was negative. Cardiovascular exam, showed an a regular rate with no murmur or friction rub, as well as a regular, PMI was normal upon inspection. For her respiratory or her, sorry. According to her, she was not presenting with anything. Her, pulmonary ROS shows wheezing, orthoptia, and dyspnea. Her MSK, she claims a lower extremity edema and neuro was good. On her physical exam, we found in the neck, no carotid brewery. She did have, jugular venous distension. She was tachycardic. She had a normal PMI, No friction rub or murmur, or gallop noted on auscultation. Respiratory exam showed, bivasilar rails and wheezing, And that concludes the physical exam portion. So for orders, we, sent her to the ICU, took vitals every 2 hours, put her on strict bed bed rest, a strict IO, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. We placed her on BiPAP. For labs, we ordered PTINR and serial troponins. For her medications, we discontinued metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and furosemide. We we continue to occur clopidogrel and warfarin, and we added dobutamine as well as placed her on an insulin sliding scale. And post visit, we consulted interventional cardiology for potential, AICD or CRTD placement. Thank you. And this concludes my, case presentation."
"Okay. Start. Today, I assessed, Leslie Palmer. She came in with a cheap com chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue with a 2 month history of this. She went and saw her primary care physician 3 days ago, and then got a lot worse today, called them, and they said to come to the ED. So she presented to the ED with a chief complaint of, fatigue and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoid. She had a cardiac cath a year ago, and it came back normal. She had a family history of, cardiac sudden death on her maternal side. Her mother passed away at 40, and her father passed away, from a heart attack. Her vitals were 139 over 99, Blood pressure, her o two, she's a little bit hypoxic. She had, 91. A little bit of tachycardia. She had a 110. Respiratory rate was 20, and temperature was normal at 98.6. And so then, we did a intake. We did social history. She doesn't use alcohol, drugs, tobacco. She drinks coffee, just a cup a day. She's currently employed school teacher. She is unable to exercise. She's NYHA of 3. So rest does help, but every other kind of activity does make her, have her symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath. She's currently for her blood pressure taking Lisinopril 10, milligrams, and for her sarcoid, she's taking prednisone, 10 milligrams as well. She's got no allergies. She had a bit of a weight gain about £8, and again, fatigued, no skin, ROS, no h e e n t r o s. She did have a pre syncope. She's never passed out, but she does feel like she's going to pass out. She said she had a fluttering in her chest and actually used the word palpitations. She's got dyspnea, orthopnea, wheezing, some lower extremity edema. She did have JBD. All of her neuro ROS was negative. No gate change, no confusion. She's awake, alert, oriented. She's just tired, fatigued. She didn't have any cardiac brew or no carotid bruise. She did have JVD. She had a regular heart rate. Sure. PMI was normal on inspection. There was a murmur. There was an s 4 murmur, and there was a gallop, no friction rub, and, no regular rate. She did have wheezes and bilazeral bi bilasal oils. She had no chest wall tenderness, and was on respiratory distress. Her calves were not tender. She did have, plus 1 putting edema. Her pulses, her peripheral peripheral pulses were full and equal. She did not have a Hohmann sign. So then we did her imaging and her x-ray. She showed normal heart size. She did have pulmonary, edema and some mediastinal fullness as well as, she had the characteristic pawnbroker sign on chest x-ray. Her labs did show a, elevated BNP at 4000, and I informed the patient of what that meant, and her echo came back with a restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness ejection fraction of 55%. She I gave her the diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and I admitted her to telemetry. Her condition is serious. I did vital q 2, out of bed of assistance, nursing intervention, strict IO, daily weight, 2 nasal cannula, maintain her o two stat because she was a little bit hypoxic at 91. We did low sodium, KVO, IV fluids, and I continued her Lisinopril at 10 milligrams. I upped her prednisone to 60 milligrams, amiodarone because her EKG did show that she had non sustained ventricular, tachycardia. So she had 3 or more, of the consecutive ventricular beats in v 1, v 2, and v 3. The access was normal, and it was a normal sinus rhythm as well. So she had an EKG cardiac dysrhythmia of non sustained b tach. So we would place her on amiodarone 150 IV. So I also put her on some furosemide 40 milligrams IV, to help with that fluid in the legs. No endocrine, no BiPAP. We did order a CNP. We did no more diagnostic orders, and I consulted a radiology and an interventional cardiologist, for an AICD placement and a pop a possible PET scan. Other than that, I believe everything else on her physical exam we have covered, and we admitted the patient to telemetry. Thank you."
"I just met with Leslie Palmer. He's a 62 year old male who presented the ED with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue that's gradually worsened over the past 6 months. He's unable to carry out any exercise and is having symptoms at rest. He expressed that he's been sleeping in a chair at night, because he can't lay down because of his shortness of breath. He denied any pain and stated that he went to his family med doc 3 days ago, and they told him if it gets worse, to go to the EB. So that's why he came in. His past medical history, he has hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and AFib, and his immunosagents are up to date for his meds. He's on atorvastatin 10 mgs every day, clopidogrel 75 mgs every day, verosamide 20 mgs twice a day, metoprolol succinate 50 mgs every day, Lisinopril 10 mgs every day, metformin 500 mgs twice a day, and warfarin 2.5 mgs twice a day. He has had a CABG 12 years ago, and he had 5 stents placed. And the cardiologist said he doesn't qualify for any more stents. His dad is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's, and his mom died of breast cancer. He's a balanced diet. He walks every day, doesn't use illicit drugs. He's a pack a day smoker, and we talked about potentially quitting. He doesn't drink alcohol, drinks a cup of coffee a day. He's a school teacher, and he's married and lives with his family. He has no allergies. And for his forgiveness systems, he expressed fatigue and an 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks. He has swelling in his legs, no skin, eyes, ear, nose, and throat, or neuro problems. He denied palpitation, syncope, and chest pain, and he has wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. His vitals, his temp was normal at 98.6. He, has a heart rate of 90. Respiratory rate was up at 22. His BP was hypotensive at 80 over 50. And his oxygen was low at 86%. On physical exam, I found no carotid bruise. He did have JVD. No murmurs, he was tachycardic. His PMI was displaced laterally, he had wheezing and rales, but he wasn't in respiratory distress, and he had just wall tenderness. His calves weren't tender, he had pedaledema, and his posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses were full and equal. On his imaging, he had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Also got an echo done that showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction less than 30 percent, and he also had an EKG that was normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. His troponins and BNP's were elevated on his lab work. So my differential was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, dilated myo cardiomyopathy, restricted cardiomyopathy. But I diagnosed him with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy because of his medical history of having hyper hypolodemia, hypertension, diabetes, and having all those scents placed, and his echo showed that he had to reduce ejection fraction. So I went ahead and admitted him to the ICU. He's in serious condition, get vitals every 2 hours, still on strict bed rest, strict IO, daily weight, CVT prophylaxis. He's on a low sodium diet, KBOIV fluids. I discontinued all his meds except for his competent girl in warfarin, and I added a dobutamine IV drip. Put him on an insulin sizing scale, and he's on BiPAP for his low oxygen. I ordered to repeat the PTT INR and Cyril Troponin Labs, And, I ordered him to have a consult with the interventional cardiologist for an ICD or CRT placement. But he has a good support system with his family to take care of him, and he seemed like he was in good spirits and just really wanted to have his symptoms go away. So, hopefully, the medication we give him will help with that."
"Doing well this morning. A 62 year old man came into the ED this morning. Name is Leslie Palmer. He presented the ED with shortness of breath and fatigue that has been worsening over the last 6 months, state that states that his shortness of breath, happens at rest and gets worse with any physical activity. His vitals were his heart rate was, 90. His respiration rate was 22. BP was 80 or 50, and o two stats were down low at 86%. He has a past medical history of Afib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He has had a triple bypass in the in the past and five stents. His mom died of breast cancer. His dad currently has Alzheimer's. He's a pack a day smoker in good health, good diet, good exercise, no alcohol or drugs. He has a long list of medication, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, Lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known known drug allergies. On his review of systems, he presented with fatigue, as I mentioned, weight gain, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and he did present with lower extremity edema. On physical exam, he had jugular jugular venous distension, an irregular rate with a split s 2. His PMI was displaced laterally. He did present with RAILs and wheezing, but no chest wall tenderness, and he did present with pedal edema. On his chest x-ray, it showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo showed DCM with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, and his EKG showed a left bundle branch with LVH bolted criteria. His troponin was 0.04 and his BNP was 4,000. I did diagnose him with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an NYHA class 4, and I admitted him to the ICU because of that. Vitals every 2 hours, strict bed rest, low sodium diet, KBO fluids. I kept him on his clopidogrel and his warfarin, but I took him off everything else, and I added dobutamine IV. And I put him on an insulin sliding scale. I put him on BiPAP because his o two stats were so low. I also had PTINR because he's still on warfarin and seriotroponins to make sure that's, going in the correct direction. And then I referred him to the interventional cardiologist for ICD and CRTD placement. Thank you so much, and hope you have a good day."
"Today, I had the pleasure of seeing 62 year old male, mister Leslie Palmer. He presented with shortness of breath and fatigue and was referred to the ER by his family medicine physician. His vitals, were at a heart rate at 90, blood pressure at 80 over 50, and a o two set of 86%, and respiratory rate of 22. He has been diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He has had a triple bypass surgery done as well as 5 stents put in, and his last stent, was in the LAD in, June of 2022. His current medications include Lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metformin, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, and warfarin. His physical exam revealed JVD tachycardia with, a split s 2, rails in the lungs, a displaced PMI, and pitting edema in the lower extremities. In terms of relevant ROS, he has had a weight gain of about £8 recently and has been experiencing fatigue, orthopnea, and dyspnea. He smokes every day, and I did counsel him on stopping to avoid exasperating the symptoms that he's currently, experiencing. Lastly, I look at I looked at his labs and imaging and reviewed, it with the patient. His troponin and BNP levels were elevated. His x-ray revealed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, and his echo revealed left ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of less than 35%. And according to his EKG, it looks like he had normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, and a left bundle branch block. I diagnosed him with ischemic dilate cardiomyopathy and referred him to the cardiologist. I also took him off of all of his medications except for the clopidogrel, warfarin, and added dobutamine. I submitted the rest of his nursing orders, and has now and he has now been admitted to the ICU. Thank you."
"Reporting on missus Leslie Palmer, who presented today to the emergency department, complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath, and adult achy chest pain that began about 2 weeks ago. She noted about this time about 2 weeks ago, she was sick with flu like symptoms, but these symptoms resolved about 5 days ago, these flu like symptoms specifically. However, her fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain have only gotten worse over the past several days. She knows that she is unable to exercise to her normal limits without her without these symptoms, and she's been sleeping in a chair at night due to pretty severe orthopnea. She denies taking anything to alleviate her symptoms, and she rates her symptoms at a 2 out of 10. She does have a past medical history of hypertension for which she is taking Lisinopril. She also has a surgical history of a cardiac catheterization. She is an overall pretty healthy patient who exercises regularly and has a balanced regular diet. She's also up to date on all of her immunizations. As for her ROS, she does present with fatigue, and she notes some recent weight gain that's abnormal, about £8 in the last week. She does have chest pain discomfort, and she also notes some fluttering in her chest. She notes despina, despina and orthopnea. She also notes joint aches and pains as long along with lower extremity edema edema. Her vital signs today were temperature of 98.6. She was tachycardic at a 110 beats per minute, and to to to tachibnik at 20, writes per minute. Her blood pressure was also a little bit elevator elevated at a 100 30 over 90 with her o two a little low at 91%. She did on physical exam, she did have, jugular venous distension. Her hem eye was displaced a little bit laterally, but she was at a regular rate with no murmur, friction rub, or gallop. On respiratory exam, she did have wheezes and rales, but there was no chest wall tenderness. As for extremities, she did have obvious lower extremity, lower extremity edema, but her pulses were full and equal. And her calves were not tender. She also had a negative Hohmann's sign. For her chest x-ray, she did have some cardiomegaly and some pulmonary edema with a normal mediastinum. Her echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at less than 30%. Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with sinus tach and a right bundle right bundle branch block. Her troponin was a little bit elevated and her BMP was elevated at 4,000. So with all of this, I decided that she's probably experiencing Myocarditis, Dilated Cardiomyopathy. So with this I did decide to admit her to telemetry. We're doing strictizanos with, DVT prophylaxis, a low sodium diet. I'm gonna place her on acetaminophen for some of this chest pain. I'm gonna keep her on her lisinopril, but I am gonna put her on furosemide to clear out some of that fluid. As for lab orders, I'm going to do a CMP to monitor her potassium since we're adding the furosemide. I'm also gonna check serial troponin levels since they were elevated. I'm gonna repeat her echocardiogram. I'm also going to consult an interventional cardiologist, a radiologist, and an infectious disease physician. Interventional cardiologist to consider an AICD CRTD placement, a infectious disease physician to take a biopsy and assess immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, and then consulting radiology to do an MRI to look for any changes that could be caused by this myocarditis. Thank you very much."
"Leslie Palmer presents as a 62 year old female patient for chief complaints of dyspnea and fatigue. She also complains of heart palpitations and presyncope. She first started noticing her symptoms about 2 months ago and went to her primary care doctor 3 days ago for these symptoms. They are running tests now, and results are not known at this time. Symptoms have worsened in the past few days, so she was instructed by her primary care provider to come to the emergency room. She notes that symptoms improve when she lays in her chair and with rest, when she sleeps in her chairs and with rest, and symptoms worsen when she lays flat and with most physical activity. Patient has a symptom, a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. 25 years ago, she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. She has no known drug allergies. She had a cardiac catheterization 1 year ago and reports that the results were normal. Her father passed away from a myocardial infarction, and her mother passed away from an unknown cause. She follows a balanced diet. She used to walk regularly, but notes that she cannot exercise now due to her symptoms. She drinks 1 cup of coffee a day and denies any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Patient is an elementary school teacher and lives with her spouse. So patient in the review system, patient complains of fatigue, a weight gain of £8 in the last 2 weeks, a demon in her lower extremities, palpitations, heart palpitations, presyncope, dipsian, orthopnea. Patient denied having any other skin, musculoskeletal, neurological, or, head, ears, eyes, neck, and throat symptoms nose and throat symptoms. Her vitals were taken upon entry with a high respiratory rate of on the higher end of normal of 20, and then high heart rate of a 110, a higher blood pressure of 136 over 99, and a low o two saturation of 91%. A patient was informed of their vitals and that we were going to continue to monitor them. Physical exam was then performed. We found jugular vein distension and no bruise. The heart had a regular rhythm, but a systolic s 4 murmur with gallops and no regurgitation sounds. Point of maximal impulse was normal. Bipasilar rails and wheezing were appreciated. Patient had a plus 1 pittingpedal edema. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tubialis pulses were full and equal, negative Hohmann's sign, and osteopathic screening was done of her back, and no chart changes, and no Chapman's points were appreciated. The chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and mediastinal fullness. The echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy, with increased wall thickness and an ejection fracture of fraction of 55%. The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and nonsustained with periods of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, troponin sustained with periods of non sustained ventricular tachycardia. Troponin levels were normal, but the BNP levels were elevated at 4,000. Patient was then counseled on the diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is in and was classified as an NYHA class 3. She will be admitted to telemetry in serious condition and will was told that she could get out of bed with assistance. Fidals will be taken every 2 hours and loaves, and she will adhere to a low sodium diet. Nursing interventions included strict IO daily weights, oxygen, delivered via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute to maintain a saturation level over 96% and DVD prophylaxis. IV fluids are administered, KBO. Patient will continue her Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily, increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams daily and add amiodarone 150 milligrams via IV, q 10 minutes. And furosemide, a 40 milligrams IV every 12 hours. Patient will also have a complete metabolic panel, done as well to check her, potassium. And she will see interventional cardiology to discuss, IAICD placement and radiology to get an FDG PET scan. Patient has support from her spouse and no further questions at this time."
"I saw mister Palmer today. Leslie is a 62 year old male who presents to the ER for the cheap complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. Mister Palmer has been experiencing these symptoms for 6 months and saw a family medicine physician 3 days ago who ordered tests but did not go through them with him. The PCP referred him to the ER for which he is here today. He reports symptoms that have progressively been worsening, and he needs elevation when sleeping using a recliner. The fatigue and shortness of breath have, been constant at rest and worsen with any and all physical activity. Mister Palmer has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with metoprolol succinate 50 mg, Lisinopril 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, metformin 500 mg, borosamide 20 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and warfarin 2.5 mg. His social history includes a balanced diet, moderate exercise with daily walks with friends from his neighborhood. But, recently, he reports having increased shortness of breath by walking. He has no drug or alcohol use and smokes a pack a day. He consumes 1 cup of coffee every morning, and is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with his wife. His surgical history includes a triple bypass and a stent every year for the past 5 years. However, on his last visit, his surgeon informed him that he will no longer be getting any more stents due to his ejection fraction being below 40%. He is a school teacher, and his family history includes his mother passing away from breast cancer and his father who is still alive in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. He is also up to date on all his current immunizations. He appears awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued. And after a thorough review of systems, pertinent positives include an 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks, fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and wheezing, as well as swelling in his legs. His vital signs showed normal temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90. He was to picnic with a respiratory rate of 22, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80 over 50, and a hypox and hypoxic with a pulse ox sat of 86%. Physical exam findings showed jugular venous distension, no carotid bruies, tachycardia with a split s 2, and a displaced PMI laterally. His lungs on auscultation showed bibasilar rails, and impending edema was also palpated in his lower extremities. Diagnostic lab work showed an elevation of troponin and a BNP of 4,000. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. ECHO showed dilated cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. EKG was interpreted to show normal sinus rhythm and a left bundle branch block. This led me to my diagnosis to be ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which is classified as class 4 heart failure by the New York Heart Association. The patient will now be admit admitted to the ICU on strict bed rest and will be needing, BiPAP as well to tackle the, hypoxia. He will be administer we will be administering his clopidogrel or for an endobutamine as well as an insulin sliding scale. I will also be ordering troponin and PTI in our lab work. I will consult with an interventional cardiologist to discuss treatment with a CRTD or a possible AICD as well. Thank you."
"So this is Palmer is a 62 year old email. Coming with the chief complaint of shortness breath. So she had been seeing her, her PCP. And over the past 2 months her symptoms of short breath have worsened. And so her doctor told her to come into emergency department. So she pretends today and has shortness of breath. She also complains of palpitations, presyncope. She says these symptoms have been worsening over the past few months, but she denies any sort of chest pain. She says the shortness of breath is constant and she feels it even when she's at rest. In terms of her medical history, she has a history of hypertension, a history of, sarcoidosis. She does not have any allergies. She actually says that she exercise she used to exercise once per day, but because of her symptoms, this is, decreasing, and she's no longer able to walk every day like she used to. She says that she has gained, £8 over the past 2 weeks. And then on physical examination, I found a I found a regular venous extension, no carotidaries. I listened to her heart. It sounded regular. I did hear a systolic infection murmur with an s 4, no rails, but I did hear a gallop. PMI was normal. There was no chest wall tenderness. When I was listening to her lung sounds, I heard bibasilar rails along with wheezing. While looking at her legs, I saw, hitting edema on both legs. Her pulses were equal, and her calves were nontender. Looking at her labs, her component was normal. Her BNP was 4,000. The x-ray, the heart size looked normal. I did see some, like, hilar consolidations. On echo, it showed restricted cardiomyopathy with the increased wall thickness, but her injection fraction was normal. EKG showed sinusachycardia and right bundle branch block. So with all of this, I think what's going on is that she is having a, sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy, an exacerbation of her of her pulmonary sarcoidosis. So what I want to do is I want to admit her, to the telemetry unit. I'm going to consider or continue her, Lisinopril. I'm going to add on amiodarone and increase, add on amiodarone and furosemide. I'm also going to increase her prednisone dose. I want to order another CMP, so we want that BMP. I'm also going to consult the cardiologist and the radiologist so we can get some some more, lab results in."
"68 year old female that came into the office today, with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. 2 weeks ago, she presented to an office, due to her fever and cough. And then 5 days ago, she had to go back because of her chest pain and shortness of breath. 3 days ago, she went to another doctor and they told her to come here due to her symptoms not improving. She says the shortness of breath does not improve with, Tylenol or I'm sorry. Her physical activity causes her shortness of breath. She has a constant chest pain that is dull and is not alleviated by Tylenol. She said, to out of a scale of 10, her pain is 2. I give her a NYH score of 3 due to her, decrease in physical activity, and she has to sleep in a recliner. When I did my physical exam, there was a positive JBD as, there were no cardiac bruise. There was some, lower extremity edema. The neuro exam was negative. Pulmonary, she had RAILs with osmia, dyspnea, and wheezing. Cardio, her PMI was displaced as well as experiencing palpations in chest pain. And then just in general, she was oriented, but she was fatigued and had some slight weight gain probably due to the edema. Her labs are CBC, PTINR negative. Troponium was slightly elevated. BNP elevated. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Our 2 d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed sinus hagocardia with a right bundle branch block as well as a left access deviation. After speaking to the patient and doing the physical exam, I decided that she had myocarditis dilated, dilated cardiomyopathy. So we are going to admit her to telemetry. Condition serious. She has no known drug allergies, vitals every 2 hours or activities as tolerated. She's gonna be on strict IO daily weight, DBT prophylaxis. Her o two stats were lows at 91%, so we're gonna put on o two, via nasal cannula and maintain an o two stat of 96%. Put on a low sodium diet and fluid restriction, put on a saline lock KBO. She is currently on Lisinopril 10 milligrams, so we're gonna keep that. But we're also gonna add a 625 milligrams acetaminophen every 6 hours to help with the pain. And then furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to try to get rid of some of that fluid. We're gonna keep an eye on her troponins. We are gonna repeat the echo and we are gonna do CNP. We will be consulting interventional cardiologist for a CRTD and AICD placement to help get her rhythm back to normal. As well as a infectious disease to consider for glucocorticoids. And we're gonna do a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Also gonna consult a radiologist to do a contrast media enhanced MRI. Patient does have a husband that is here at the hospital. He'll be helping her and supporting her with that. And other than that, her vitals heart rate was elevated at 110. As I said, her o two stats were low, and she had a BP of 130 over 90."
"Good afternoon. I would like to present to you a patient I've just finished seeing at the emergency room. Missus Palmer is a 62 year old female with a history of hypertension who presents with the chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue with accompanying chest pain. These symptoms have been occurring over 2 weeks and are worsening. She describes the chest pain as sharp, central, non radiating, and a 2 out of 10 severity. Symptoms are worsened with some exertion and symptoms are alleviated by rest and sleeping in a sitting position. No treatments have been tried at this time. The patient also noticed that a recent illness consisting of fever, headache, coughing, and runny nose that dissipated 5 days ago most recently evaluated by her PCP 3 days ago. Miss Palmer currently takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, for her hypertension and claims no known drug allergies. Social history significant for a cardiac catheter 1 year ago with no complications. Family history showed a living father with Alzheimer's and a deceased mother who passed of breast cancer 5 years ago. Missus Palmer's social history is described as a regular diet with no tobacco, drug, or alcohol use with moderate caffeine intake and insufficient exercise. She's currently employed as an elementary school teacher and lives at home with her husband of 30 years. Review systems demonstrated an alert oriented patient, in pain. There was a weight gain of £8 over 2 weeks noted, as well as lower extremity edema. Cardiology noted heart palpitations, chest pain, and pulmonology assessment, demonstrated orthopnea, wheezing, the shortness of breath. Dermatology, heat, and neurology review systems raw and noncontributory. A focused physical exam was assessed with the negative Chapman's points and bilateral equal, tar changes anteriorly and posteriorly in the thoracic area. Physical exam was significant for jugular vein distension, 1 plus pitting edema, 2 plus bilateral pulses, bibasilar rails, regular heartbeats, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops with the displaced PMI laterally. The Homan sign was negative. Vitals were assessed and were significant for tachycardia at 110 bpm, elevated blood pressure at 130 over 90, tachypenic at 20 breaths per minute, and hypoxic at 91% oxygen saturation. And no fever was noted. Labs revealed elevated troponin at 0.10 and elevated b and p at 4,000. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly while echo showed enlarged left ventricle with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed a left axis, sinus tachycardia, with premature ventricular contractions and a right bundle branch block. A diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association stage 2 was made, with admission to telemetry. Patient will be placed on acetaminophen, 6 25 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours, as well as furosemide 40 milligrams via IV, while continuing her Lisinopril. I will consult a interventional cardiologist for CRTD, AICD placement, as well as endocardio endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease will be consulted for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, and, radiologists will be consulted for immediate enhanced MRI. Diets will can change of will consist of low sodium and oral fluid restriction. We'll be placing an IV fluid saline lock, with strict IO daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and o two via nasal cannula maintaining the o two saturation above 96%. Vitals will be taken every 2 hours and we will order a serotroponin and a repeat 2 d echo. Thank you very much."
"So for today's case, we have a 62 year old male presenting with fatigue and shortness of breath. Patient reports symptoms began about 6 months ago, but then 2 days ago, they got worse, so he decided to come in and see us. So he described a dyspnea and a fatigue that is constant even at rest, which in which I gave him a NYHA class 4. He feels, quote, unquote, generally tired. Sitting up relieves the dyspnea. Activity worsens it. So he has orthopnea and sleeps upright at night because it feels better for him. He has not tried any self medication, no self treatment. He rates the fatigue as an 8.9 8 or 9 out of 10. So his vitals, he was hypotensive with 80 over 50. He's tachnipia, which fast heart rate, no fast breathing rate. Sorry. Respiratory rate of 20. His low oxygen SpO 2 was 86%. So he was so in his review systems, he's positive for fatigue. He recently gained £8 in the last 2 weeks, which suggests fluid buildup. He has wheezing, shortness of breath, and orthopnea. He has bilateral lower leg edema. Past medical condition past medical history consists of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes for the last 10 years, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and he's an active smoker. Medications he takes atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, Lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. So in physical exam, the remarkable positives are he has tachycardia with a split s 2. He has jugular venous distension. His PMI is displaced laterally. He has rails, wheezing, lower extremity edema. All the other findings or for negatives were unremarkable. Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo shows normal sinus rhythm I mean, sorry, his EKG. My fault. His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria. On his labs, his troponin is elevated and his BNP is 4,000. His echo shows dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. The primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the secondary diagnosis that I gave him were because of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. So his actually, his family history that's pertinent. So his mom is passed away at 80 from breast cancer, and his father is still alive. He's 88. He has Alzheimer's. So that's the for that. So the pry we're gonna so now for our treatment plans, I want to admit him to the ICU. His condition is serious. I want vitals done every 2 hours. I wanna limit him to strict bed rest. Nurses are gonna give him strict IO, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. For fluids, he's KVO. We're gonna give him a low sodium diet. We're gonna hold everything for his medications except clopidogrel and warfarin, and I'm gonna add in a dobutamine IV drip. And, Yep. Dobutamine IV drip. We're gonna put him on a BiPAP, and we're gonna get Pete for lab where we're gonna get PTINR and serial troponins. We're transferring him to interventional cardiology for AICD and CRT, CRTD placement."
"Leslie Palmer is a 60 year old man. He presents with a shortness of breath and fatigue. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and AFib.

"64 year old female presents with shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. 2 weeks ago, she had an infection associated with a cough, cold, and fever, but it has now resolved. Now she's feeling pain in her chest, and it increases, her shortness of breath increases with exercise, and the shortness of breath is release relieved by sitting. She's not been able to lay down because of her, shortness of breath and that pain, so she's been sleeping in the chair in the chair for the past few weeks. Her review of system shows that she has fatigue and gained £8 in the past 2 weeks. She has palpitations and chest pain. She experiences wheezing, dyspnea, and ortho orthogonia, and she has swelling in her legs. She they are neuropartan and findings in skin, haint, and neuro. So past medical history, she's been diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking Lisinopril 10 mg every day. She currently has no known drug allergies. Surgical history includes a cardiac cath a year ago, but other than that, no hospitalizations. Her family history shows her mother passed from breast cancer, a cup 5 years ago, and her father is currently living in a facility a nursing home because, he is he has dementia. Social history shows she has a balanced diet, exercises 2 times a week, but hasn't been able to because of her shortness of breath, doesn't do any illicit drugs, tobacco, or drinks alcohol. She drinks a cup of coffee a day. She is currently employed as an elementary school teacher and has a partner for 30 years who is her support system. So after conducting the physical exam, I found a positive JVD sign. Her PMI was displaced laterally by basilar rails, pedal edema, and with no chest wall tenderness, and her pulses in her extremities were, 2 plus. Her vitals show she had an elevated heart rate at around a 110 beats per minute. Her o two stat was at 91%, and her BP was slightly elevated at 130 over 90. Her lab value showed she had an elevated troponin and BNP levels. Her echo shows reduced ejection fraction with dilation of left ventricle. Her EKG shows a right bundle blanche bra block and sinus tachycardia. Checks showed she had pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. After looking at all these values and, conducting the physical exam and getting her history, I'm diagnosing her with myocarditis cardiomyopathy. A secondary diagnosis could be dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, but given her recent recent infection a couple weeks ago, I am going to assume it is the myocarditis cardiomyopathy. So my plan for her right now is to admit her to telemetry and administer acetaminophen for the pain she's feeling, acetaminophen 625, and IV furosemide for the swelling in her legs, and keep her on that Lisinopril. Nursing orders include strict IO, daily weight check, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula, and maintain her o two stat greater than 96%. I wanna talk to infectious disease, the cardiologist, and radiologist to come up with a plan for this patient. This includes CRTD and AICD placement, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, immune globulin or glucocorticoids, and a medical medically enhanced MRI. Cause of her, myocarditis is because of her recent, infection that she's experienced 2 weeks ago, and her she currently does have insurance because of her job, and her husband will be meeting her at the hospital."
"Good afternoon, doctor Rollins. I saw miss Leslie today. She is a 62 year old, woman who presents to the office for a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, heart flutter, and palpitations. Miss Leslie was in her usual state of excellent excellent health, until 2 months ago when she developed worsening, shortness of breath and palpitations. She reports, the symptoms being better at rest And when she's elevated and worse during physical activity, she does feel like, passing out at times. She does not complain of radiating pain. Miss Leslie does have a history of sarcoidosis, which she was diagnosed, 25 years ago and is currently being treated, for hypertension with Lisinopril along with the along with Lisinopril, she reports taking prednisone as well. She has no known allergies. Her social history includes a balanced diet, limited exercise, no drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, and moderate caffeine use. She is an elementary school teacher. She is, sexually active and in a relationship. Her past surgical history includes a cardiac cath about 1 year ago, and she has no prior hospitalizations. Her father died of a heart attack at 59, and her mother had a sudden death at 40. She appears awake, alert oriented, fatigue, and presents with weight gain of about £8 and swollen ankles. Review of systems, of her skin was negative. Review of systems of her, musculoskeletal component was negative, and her blood pressure was elevated at 136 over 99, and her heart rate was also elevated at 110. Upon palpitation, edema was noted in her ankles. Lower extremity pulses were normal bilaterally. She did present with RAILs bilaterally and wheezing. She was active she was negative for Coleman's test and had no tart or spinal abnormalities, during her osteopathic screening. Her chest x-ray showed normal cardiac silhouette, mediastinal fullness, and, pulmonary edema. Her BNP was elevated at 4,000. Troponin was still at normal levels. Her EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a nonsustained left ventricular tachycardia. Her t 2 d echo showed, increased wall thickness with an ejection fraction of 50%, and she was up to date with her immunizations. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy and was admitted to telemetry. In terms of medication, amiodarone 150 mg and furosemide 40 mg IV was added, and, prednisone was increased to 60 mg from 10 mg. She will be on a low sodium diet and will be receiving out of bed assistance. CMP was ordered and an interventional cardiology consult for AICD, for AICD placement nuclear med consult for, FDG PET was indicated. She will be continuing her lisinopril, medication."
"Mister Leslie Palmer presented to the immersion department today with, shortness of breath and fatigue. Claim has been happening for the past 6 months, getting worse, as the 6 months progressed. Saw his family medicine doctor, 3 weeks ago or 3 days ago, excuse me, and they were, gave him some tests, told him they were gonna talk about the test in a few days. It got worse. They called him he called him and said to come back, to go to the ER. So he's here in the ER today. Says the symptoms have been, like I said, getting worse. They're worse when he lays down, the shortness of breath. So he's been sleeping in a chair the past few weeks, he says. There has been he has a history of multiple stents placed at 5 in the past 5 years, I believe. And also, open heart surgery, CABG, 12 years ago. 5th 15 years ago. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and was recently diagnosed with atrial fib. No drug allergies, pack a day smoker for the past 30 years, no alcohol or drug use. He is employed as an elementary school teacher, has insurance through his work, and a married family support system. No relevant, family medical history. Currently medicated on lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, metformin, furosemide, clopidogrel, and warfarin, all for the previous diagnosis said before. Presented, well dressed, well nourished, oriented. He, was very oriented, just fatigued. Did not seem to be seem to be in any apparent pain. Review systems shown he had a a JVD present, no carotid breweries, tachycardic with a split s 2, heard on auscultation, no heart murmurs or gallops or friction rub. He had a laterally displaced PMI on palpitation. Listening to lung sounds, he had, rails were present. Also, like I said, orthopnea, can't, can't breathe while lying down, short of breath, this and the with exertion and wheezing. He also says the fatigue and shortness of breath is even on rest, so go into a class 3 heart failure. On his lab, as he came back, PTNIR was elevated and as well Troponin and BNP. 2 d echo showed that he had a dilated cardiomyopathy with, ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis, probably because of that cardiomegaly and then a lateral PMI. Left bundle branch block and, left ventricular hypertrophy, the voltage criteria was met. Chest x-ray shows edema, cardiomegaly. So we went ahead and diagnosed them with, ischemic, cardi excuse me. Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It would, reduce ejection fraction 30%, gonna administer him to the ICU. It's a serious condition. We're gonna get his vitals checked for 2 hours. Strict eyes and nose, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, getting them on a BiPAP 16 over 6, 50%, saline with a KBO. Then a positive is, current meds right now except for the warfarin and clopidogrel. Go ahead and add a dobutamine drip drip because of that low blood pressure. And also his vitals showed a low blood pressure of 80 over 60, 80 over 50, excuse me, with a heart rate of 90, oxygen stats 86%. So that's why we wanna go ahead and get them on the BiPAP, dobutamine for that low blood pressure. Also, insulin stuff, keep track of those sugars, keep them stable. Go ahead and order more serial troponins to check how he's doing as well as PTI and R since he's on that warfarin. With that AFib, we don't want any extra clotting to occur. From there, gonna go ahead and, give them, interventional cardiology consult potential for a, CRTD and AICD, placement. Other than that, seemed present, happy, just in fatigue and trouble. So hope we'll get him taken care of. Alright. Thank you."
"Hello, doctor Rollins. I'd like to present the case of mister Leslie Palmer. He is a 62 year old male who presents today with shortness of breath and severe fatigue. This all started about 6 months ago, but has gotten worse in the last 3 days. He went to see his primary care physician and was instructed to come to the emergency department. He said he doesn't know any of the test results that he, took at the primary care physician. The shortness of breath occurs even at rest, and he's forced to sleep in his recliner due to symptoms worsening when lying down. So, he really doesn't feel good today, and, like, it's been bad around the clock pretty much. He is ex from my review of systems, I see he's he said that he has fatigue, had an 8 pound, has gained £8 in the last week. He's experiencing wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Everything else was negative. His prior medical history, he does have hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and recent AFib. His past family history, his mother died at the age of 80 from breast cancer. His father is still alive, but in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. For some pertinent surgical history, he did have a CABG 12 years ago. He's had 5 stents in the last 5 years with the last one being in his LED. His cardio his cardiologist told him he is not able to get any more stents after this, and his most recent echo showed a 40% ejection fraction. For his medications, he is treating his medical history. He he is on Lisinopril, 10 mgs, atorvastatin, 10 mgs, clopidogrel, 75 mgs, metformin, 500 mgs, furosemide, 20 mgs, metoprolol succinate for 50 mgs, and warfarin, 2 and a half mgs. He does not have any known drug allergies. As for his social history, he claims to eat a balanced diet. He used to go on walks daily, but due to his recent symptoms, has not been able to. He has been smoking for the last 30 years about a pack a day. He consumes caffeine, just one cup of coffee a day. No tobacco or alcohol. He is an elementary school teacher teaching 5th grade, and he is sexually active with his wife who's also his social support system at home. His vital signs showed a temperature of 98.6, respiratory rate of 22, blood pressure of 80 over 50, and a sp02 of 86%, which is a little low. From my physical exam, some pertinent positives were a JBD, tachycardia with split s 2 and a gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally. He did have bivascular rails and wheezing and one plus pinning edema in his lower extremities. The negatives were there were no bruise, no regurgitation, no chest wall tenderness, no calf tenderness, and pulses were full full and equal, dorsalis pedis pulse. My primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with, NYHA class 4 due to the symptoms being present at rest. My secondary diagnoses are hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. So my plan for this patient is to admit him to the ICU. His labs also showed elevated troponin and BNP, so I would like serial troponins taken. As for his, other lab results, he did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension on chest x-ray. His EKG had a left bundle branch block and left axis, and his echo had a dilated left ventricular left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction from his last one down to 30% this time. In the ICU, I would like him to be on strict bed rest. INOs, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. I am gonna put him on BiPAP 16 over 6, a low sodium diet, and, put in a IV to just to keep the vein open, AstraMeds. I am gonna keep him on his clopidogrel and warfarin of 75 and 2.5 mix respectively. I am gonna add in IV dobutamine and put him on an insulin sliding scale. For his labs, as I said, I would like serial components, but I'm also gonna get a PTINR. And I am gonna consult interventional radiology to put in a CRTD and AICD. I think all with all these combined, you can really get mister Palmer where he needs to be. Thank you so much."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of palpitation, shortness of breath, and feeling fatigue progressively for the past 2 months. She states that she's gonna pass out, occasionally whenever she does any activity. She denies any feeling any symptoms like these in the past. Her symptoms worsen with any activity and especially when she she's trying to lay down. She denies any radiation of the pain or any of her symptoms, and she rates her symptoms 7 out of 10 in terms of severity. She states that she followed up with her primary care physician 3 days ago and had blood work and imaging done at the same time. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She's currently on Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily as well as prednisone 10 milligrams daily. Her past surgical history is significant for cardiac catheterization that she had about 1 year ago, which was reportedly normal. She denies any tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, and states that she has a balanced diet and tries to exercise every day. Her mother her mother passed away from sudden cardiac death at the age of 40, and her father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Her reviews of system was positive for feeling fatigued, weight gain, palpitation, presyncope, dyspnea with exertion, orthopnea, wheezing, and lower extremity edema. Her vitals showed, blood pressure of 136 over 90, pulse of 110, respiration rate of 20, temperature of 98.6, oxygen saturation of 91, and heart rate of 110. Physical exam findings were significant for as for murmur, javier vein distension, bibasilar rails, wheezing, and pedal edema. However, Dorsalis fetus pulse was full and equal on both sides. PMI was noted to be normal, and there were no carotid breweries noted. Labs showed BMP levels elevated at 4,000. However, troponin levels were normal. Chest actually findings showed normal cardiac celibate sign. However, it was noted to have widened mediastinum as well as pulmonary edema. 2 d echo cardiogram showed that patient had restricted cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness as well as ejection fraction of 55%. EKG showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and normal sinus rhythm. And patient was noted to have, sarcoidosis restricted cardiomyopathy based on all the labs and imaging findings and was advised to admit to telemetry. She was also started on amiodarone 150 milligrams IV as well as furosemide 50 milligrams IV dosage. Her prednisone dose prednisone dose was increased from 10 milligrams to 60 60 milligrams daily, and she was advised to continue rest of her medications. Miss Palmer was miss Palmer was also advised to consult with interventional cardiology for automatic implantable cardio cardioverter defibrillator as well as radiology for a PET scan. She was agreeable to all the, consultation and management plan that was given to her."
"I saw earlier in the ED, miss Foster. She presented with a 2 month history of, chest puppet, chest blooders and, dizziness on exertion. She states that over the last 3 days, it's gotten worse. She saw her doctor who had ordered some lab tests, but when she called in and said things have gotten worse the last couple of days, they recommended that she, go to the ED, so she'd present it today. She states that she's having to be, sleeping in a chair due to, orthopnea. At night, she has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis. As far as her, past medical history, she has history of hypertension, which she takes Lisinopril 4, and she's also currently on 10 milligrams of prednisone for her sarcoidosis. Past, surgical history includes cardiac cath that she sent. Went well, last year. And her family history on her mother's side, she says that, her mother died at age 40 from a from sudden death. They weren't exactly sure occurred. And her father is also deceased at age 50, 9 from from an MI. As far as her social history, she does not drink alcohol, does not use tobacco, does not use illicit drugs. She's a teacher. Her occupation diet is well balanced. She does drink one cup cup of coffee a day. She states that she normally will exercise, like, walking with her friends, but recently due to, her the in the inability of, the shortest of breath upon exertion. She has no longer continued to walk with her friends. Lives living situation is stable. She has support at home. No known drug allergies. As doing her review of systems, she was, she had some fatigue, but and some recent, 8 pound weight gain in the last couple of weeks that she's noticed. Her skin, no, nothing of noticeable there. All negative. Nothing, regarding her, head. No recent headaches, neck stiffness, difficulty seeing her vision. As far as her cardiac evaluation, she noted some fluttering palpitations in her chest along with, some near syncope events, with exertion. As far as her respiratory, we already discussed that she had had some, dyspnea and, orthopnea. She had some lower extremity edema, but otherwise no muscle aches or pains. Neuro, she had no confusion, dizziness, or, gait disturbances, that she had noticed. As as as far as I could tell, she was alert and oriented. She did have some fatigue. Vital signs were 136 over 99, heart rate of 110, and respirations of 20. SPO 2 was at 91. When I further did an evaluation, of the patient, she had a positive JVD, with, but no carotid bruit. Right her, heart rate was regular, but there was an s 4, murmur noted, the positive gallop and no regurge. She did have some peripheral edema, lung sounds. She had some bilateral rhonchi, with wheezing. After the physical exam, some x rays and a echo along with an EKG were ordered. I interpreted, at the patient's bed size those results. Her lab showed elevated BNP, with normal troponin. Her EKG showed, not sustained, ventricular tachycardia with otherwise normal sinus rhythm. And her, echocardiogram showed, restriction, in her it showed restricted cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness, but the ejection fraction was still, 55%. Upon, reading her chart, examining the patient and looking over her, lab results and x rays, I determined the patient most likely, was having, cardiomyopathy related, to her sarcoidosis. I advise that the patient be admitted to telemetry. Vitals every couple of hours. She can be, on bed rest, but out of out of bed rest with assistance. Put her on strict I, ISO IO, daily weight, oxygen to, bump up her stats, and DVT prophylaxis. And I rec also recommended that we, continue her lisinopril, but up her pregnancy to 60 milligrams. Put her on IV furosemide for her pulmonary edema, along with, recommended that we get repeat CNP labs, to check the furosemide, and consulted radiology and endometrial cardiology to look at place look at a I, AICD placement along with a PET scan, to further evaluate her sarcoidosis. And that's all I have."
"Today, mister Palmer is a 62 year old man who presents to the office for the chief complaint of dyspnea with exertion and fatigue. Mister Palmer is an elementary school teacher with a wife of 30 years. He was in his usual state of excellent health until week 2 weeks ago prior to admission when he developed an acute onset of shortness of breath. He reports walking with his coworkers after work when he felt the symptoms, before admission. He describes the symptoms to be generalized throughout his body with a constant duration during exertion. Exercise seems to make it worse. He does not complain of any radiating pain. He rates his pain as a 5 out of 6 on a scale of 0 to 10. Mister Palmer has a history of high blood pressure, which he was diagnosed with hypertension and is currently being treated for this with, Lisinopril 10 milligrams. Along with the Lisinopril, he does not report any over the counter herbal medications. Mister Palmer does not report any allergies. His social history includes a balanced diet, regular exercise before onset before the onset of symptoms 2 weeks ago. No drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, and regular regular caffeine consumption of 1 and a half cups of coffee every morning. He works as an elementary school teacher and is sexually active with his wife. He has a positive surgical history of a cardiac cath performed 1 year ago at his yearly physical. He's had no hospitalizations. Family history is positive for his pa father passing away at age 59 from an MI and his mother passing away at age 40 from a sudden cardiac death. Today, mister Palmer appears awake, alert oriented, and presents with no fatigue, fever, chills, weight loss, or weight gain. Review of symptoms of his skin was negative with no rash, bruzings, lesions, or color changes or warmth touch. Review of systems of his MSK was negative. No muscle back or joint pain. Review of pulmonary systems was positive for wheezing and dyspnea with exertion. Review of cardiovascular systems was positive for palpitations, near syncope, but no passing out. No no full syncope, and s four murmur and a laterally displaced PMI. His vital signs seemed abnormal with an elevated BP of 130 over 90. Other vital signs were normal with a BPM of 110 and oxygen saturation of 96%. No carotid and brulee or JVD were noted. No chest wall tenderness. Auscultation and palpate palpation of the epigastric area was a negative for no Bruy or pulsatile mass. Lower extremity pulses were normal bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Hohmann's sign was negative, and caps were symmetrical. OMM examination of the thoracic spine was normal, no with known tar with no notable tart changes. Upon palpation, no lower no lower extremity edema was noted. Review of labs, ordered by the family med physician 3 days ago showed cardiomegaly on chest x-ray. Troponin and BNP were within normal limits. And a 2 d echo, performed showed an asymmetrical left ventricle with a enlarging enlarged interventricular septum and an ejection fraction of 60%. Today, mister Palmer was diagnosed with familial hypertrophic, obstructive cardiomyopathy and is in serious condition. I counseled mister Palmer to be admitted to telemetry and to check vitals q two hours. He was counseled for activity as tolerated and a regular diet. Lisinopril 10 milligrams was discontinued, and disopiramide 100 milligrams QID was instead started. Referrals to interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgery for possible septal myomectomy and alcohol injection were, counseled. Thank you."
"Mister Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male with a history of hypertension and presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and a presyncope episode 2 weeks ago while walking. The, associated, episode was with dyspnea that was aggravated while walking in any kind of physical activity but was relieved with rest. Therefore, he falls under the neurotic heart association classification of 2. The patient also described wheezing as well as rasping and fluttering that, last for the duration of any kind of exertion. Patient described there was no history of cough, chest pain, no weight loss, or fever, chills, or sweats. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease include a positive family history of an MI on the father's side that passed away at 69 years old and a maternal medical history of sudden cardiac death. Currently, patient is taking Lisinopril for their hypertension and has no known drug allergies. They did have a surgical history of a heart cath. And as for their social history, they have a balanced diet and were very active exercising, but as of now, they have shortness of breath while walking. It's moderate consumption use of, caffeine and no consumption of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. They are an, elementary sorry. They are a middle school teacher and that lives with their husband. So as for their vital signs, the patient has, vitals of blood pressure of a 130 over 90, a temperature of 98 point 6, a heart rate of a 110, respiratory rate of 20, and a saturation of oxygen of 91%, and they appear to wake alert and oriented. I performed a cardiopulmonary physical exam that indicated no carotid bruise and did have a jugular venous distension. They had a regular heart rate, no murmurs, friction rub, or gallops present, but a laterally displaced PMI. As for respiratory, had no chest wall tenderness, but wheezes were present with no respiratory distress. In the extremities, their pulses were full and equal with nontender calves and no pedal edema. I reviewed, imaging of a Chex x-ray that indicated cardiomegaly as well as, an echo that indicated left ventricular as asymmetry, with hypertrophy and an injection fraction of 60%, and their EKG, read to be a normal signs for them with a left ventricular hypertrophy criteria and tall r wave in the, septal leads. Their, labs came back showing their troponin BN2 levels is not elevated. Therefore, my assessment for this patient is a that they have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to their hypertension, and, this is because of the family history of sudden cardiac death and normal cardiovascular, markers in their labs. That's, why I'd like to admit this patient to telemetry for serious condition and checking their vitals every 2 hours, and indicated activity as tolerated with nursing interventions of daily weights, strict IOs, and nasal cannula oxygen maintaining their oxygen saturation above 96%, and DVT prophylaxis, keeping them on a low sodium diet, and, IV fluid orders for keeping the veins open. No, pain medications, but I would like to add disopiramide, a 100 milligrams per oral, and discontinue the Lisinopril in order to manage any dysrhythmias that they are experiencing. No labs are needed to be ordered as well as non imaging, but refer and for consult to interventional cardiologist for a AICD placement defibrillator as well as cardiothoracic surgery, consult for a septal myectomy for the inflammation and, management of the hypertrophy. Thank you."
"62 year old female, named Leslie Palmer. She reported to me today with a history of shortness of breath and fatigue. So the, the shortness of breath, and the fatigue have been progressively worsening over the past 6 months. And. At her visit today, she had been she had reported that the shortness of breath was occurring even at rest. So any sort of physical activity, even just walking down the hall, she reported. Shortness of breath and she is having to sleep in a chair for that reason at night, so she did have a positive orthopnea. And again, it is at rest and with physical activity. So, additionally, she's been in the past 2 weeks, she reported that she's gained about £8. And getting into some of her her medical history, she does have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Surgically, she has a history of, about 12 years ago, she had a triple bypass surgery. She's also had 5, stents placed in total, and they did inform her that she's not a candidate for further stents. She she was informed by previous physician that her ejection fraction was about 40%. Getting into some of her her medications, she provided me with a list. She she was on a good number of medications to name them. She was on Lisinopril, Metformin, warfarin, metoprolol, sutinate. She was on furosemide and. So that's it for the medications. She did not have any drug allergies. Some of her social history, she has a good, balanced diet. She did report that she is actually able to walk daily, even though she did state that she, is experiencing shortness of breath with any physical activity. She still was making the effort to walk every day, which is very good. And she does not report any use of illicit medications or other kind of medications other than what's prescribed to her. She does have a 30 pack year history. I'm sorry. 30 year history of smoking, for which she has been smoking 1 pack per day. No alcohol consumption, and she has been drinking about 1 cup of coffee every day. As far as her sexual activity, she is married. There's a monogamous relationship and her for her living situation. She is living with her husband. So getting into some of her vitals, her her blood pressure was significantly low at 80 over 50. Her pulse at about 90 and her oxygen also low at about 86, and her respiration rate was was a little bit elevated at 22. And I did discuss that with her and talk about, you know, what was standing out in in regards to her vials as well. So, getting into her physical her physical exam. Sorry. She did have, positive jugular venous distension. However, she did not have any carotid relief. She did have some, swelling in her in her, calves. So she was positive for lower extremity edema. However, her, Hohmann's sign was negative. So getting into her lab work, so troponin and BNP were both elevated. INR was not elevated. Her echo was showing, she had a reduced ejection fraction about 30%. So she had reported in the past that physician told her it was about 40, and today it was 30. So, it possibly could have have gone down. Her EKG was showing a left bundle branch block, and so using those findings, I I, my my diagnosis was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and and for which I I decided to discontinue a lot of the medications that she's currently prescribed. And I, however, I did keep her on her blood thinner. So I kept her on the warfarin, and I kept her on the clopidogrel. And I also added dobutamine for her blood pressure as it is, quite low, and I added, some insulin, because she is diabetic, and she has not been taking insulin. So I added insulin as well. I also admitted her to the ICU because of her lab work and because of her her her symptoms. I just wanted to make sure that she could be continuously monitored monitored, taken, taken good care of. So other than that, that would be my encounter. Thank you very much for listening. Bye."
"So miss Leslie is a 62 year old female, presenting with dyspnea, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and a history of progressively worsening symptoms of palpitations and these show and these troubles breathing. This has been going on for the past 2 months, when she went and finally decided to see her family doctor 3 days ago to address these symptoms. The family doctor sent her away, and then she called the family doctor today, and he told or they told her to go and visit, the emergency department. Miss Leslie has a history of hypertension and pulmonary pulmonary sarcoidosis. Upon arriving, her vitals were taken, and she had a heart rate of 1 or a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 136 over 99, and a SPO 2 of 91. Her familial history is significant for sudden death of her mother at 40 and, father dying of a heart attack at 59. What she has no known drug allergies. She's currently on Lisinopril and prednisone as well as having no, substantial social history other than living with her husband and moderate caffeine usage. Miss Leslie used to exercise, fairly frequently until the past 2 months where she's been bedridden. Miss Leslie sleeps in a chair now because of her orthopnea, so it's easier for her to breathe in a recliner, so that's where she sleeps. And she has an NYHA, scale of 3, a heart rating of 3 as she has issues with any sort of, non resting activity. Upon that upon upon, Focus Physical Museum and diagnostic findings, we determined that miss Leslie, we believe she has pulmonary, not pulmonary, sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy. We saw that with an x-ray that had pathognomonic heor, lymph node findings as well as a few simple traits within the lungs and the large heart. Yes. Miss Leslie will be admitted to the hospital in serious condition. She will receive 2 liters of o two via nasal cannula as well as increasing her prednisone, keeping her own lisinopril, as well as adding amiodarone and, furosemide to relieve edema that she has from a buildup of water in her legs or a buildup of fluid in her legs. Furthermore, we consulted radiology for an FDG PET scan as well as interventional cardiology for a AICD automatic cardiac defibrillator in her heart. A, miss Leslie was put on a low salt diet, with an IV to keep open as well as I think that might be it. During our physical exam, miss Leslie did have, abnormal cardiac findings, including a murmur and a gallop at s 4, bi bibasilar rails, and that is it. So once again, we admitted her to the hospital, and we started treatment with furosemide, prednisone, continued lisinopril, and amiodarone to treat a, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. So with that"
"Hello. Mister Palmer is a 62 year old male who presented today with, dyspnea and fatigue after being referred to us by his family doctor. He noticed fatigue and dyspnea while walking 2 weeks ago, although he states that it is better with rest and better with laying down. The dyspnea and fatigue became worse last night, and he also reports a history of presyncope, palpitations, and wheezing. He has a medical history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril, and he takes no other medications. He has no allergies. He had a cardiac cath years ago, which came back normal. And he also has a family medical history of sudden death in his mother at 40. His father died of an MI in his fifties. He is an elementary school teacher who drinks 1 cup of coffee a day, no alcohol, no tobacco, and eats a balanced diet, and he enjoys going for walks every day. Although he has been, unable to do this recently due to the dyspnea and fatigue. For his vitals, I noticed a heart rate of 110, oxygen saturation of 96, blood pressure of 130 over 90, and a respiratory rate of 16, and a temperature of 98. On physical exam, I noted a crescendo, decrescendo murmur, and a displaced PMI, which I discussed with the patient. For his imaging on the X-ray, we saw a cardiomyopathy and cardiomegaly. On the echo, we saw hypertrophy of the septum, and, on the EKG showed septal hypertrophy with increased, amplitude waves in the leads, v 1, v 2, and v 3. So the, diagnosis, which I think is most likely for his case is familial hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, which I discussed with the patient, and I prescribed disopiroamide for her and discontinued his Lisinopril. I also referred him to an interventional cardiologist, which I discussed with the patient and as a cardiovascular surgeon. Thank you."
"Leslie presents today as a female patient for an evaluation of her shortness of breath, feeling like she's gonna pass out in a heart palpitations. She states she can't do anything. She reports this began 2 months ago and has worsened over the past 3 days. She was referred here today by her family medicine doctor who sought her 3 days ago. She notes fatigue and 8 pounds weight gain over the past week. Lower extremity edema significant palpitations over the past 2 months as well as wheezing and orthopnea over the past 2 months. Her past medical history includes hypertension and the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She currently takes Lisinopril for the hypertension and prednisone for her recent medical issues. Patient currently lives with her husband who she describes as her social support, and she does have insurance. She currently works as an elementary school teacher. Prior to 2 months ago, she was an active walker. She states due to her symptoms, she is not able to do that now. Patient reports a healthy diet. She reports tachycardia or on the exam today, she had tachycardia at a heart rate of 110 and SpO 2 less than 95, hypertension at blood pressure 136 over 99, and a respiratory rate of 20. She's positive for jugular venous distension, negative for carotid roots, systolic s 4 present, gallop present, negative rubs, rails bilaterally, positive wheezing, plus 1 pitting edema. She had a bilateral lower extremity pulse and nontender calves. In summation, with the patient's history of sarcoidosis with positive exam findings as well as palmbroker sign and pulmonary edema on anterior posterior views on radiograph An echocardiogram displaying restrictive cardiomyopathy with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Normal sinus rhythm with non sustained ventricular tachycardia on electrocardiogram, negative troponin, and a brain natriptide of 4,000. She has a diagnosis of sarcoidosis sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Today, I stated that she was in New York Heart Association level 4, and this is a serious condition. So given these findings and her diagnosis, she will go to telemetry to be continue to be evaluated, And I will consult with an interventional cardiologist as well as a nuclear medicine or radiologist for further workup. She will continue Lisinopril to 100 milligrams every day. Amiodarone, a 150 milligrams intravenously. Prednisone will be increased to 60 milligrams every day and furosemide, 40 milligrams intravenously. Repeat bottles will be taken every 2 hours. And if she decides to get out of bed, she will need assistance. And that is my case presentation for Leslie. Thank you."
"Presenting with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. Her symptoms began 6 months ago when she visited and she visited her PCP 3 days ago. She reports that she cannot catch her breath, but states that there is no accompanying chest pain. She describes arthopnea in which reclining improves her symptoms and her symptoms worsen with activity. In terms of Leslie Palmer's past medical history, she has reported atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperellymphedema, diabetes, and her immunizations are up to date. In terms of past surgical history, she reports a previous cardiac stent. In fact, there have been 5 cardiac stents, and she's no longer a candidate for any future ones. And she has also undergone, a bypass graft or a CABG. In terms of her maternal family history, her mother has passed due to breast cancer and her father is alive, but is suffering from Alzheimer's. In terms of her social history, she reports no alcohol use, tobacco use active about a pack per day, and no illicit drug use. She's currently employed. Her diet is regular and balanced. She reports 1 cup per day in terms of caffeine. She exercises regularly prior to having these symptoms. Now she can no longer exercise. And, she lives with her husband. In terms of medications, she takes atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. And let's see. In terms of drug allergies, she has no known drug allergies. When assessing her ROS, she does suffer from fatigue. She reports weight gain. There have been no skin, abnormalities. And when it comes to heat, there are also no abnormalities. And when assessing her chest, she reported no chest pain, no palpitations. They were all negative. When it comes to her lungs, she reports wheezing. Again, orthopnea as described in dyspnea. When it comes to muscular musculature, she does have lower extremity edema. And in terms of her neurological examination, there was nothing there it was all negative. Her vital signs were a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90, rather high respiratory rate at 22, a low blood pressure, hypotension at 80 over 50, and her sp02 was also at 86, which was low. When assessing her neck, there was JVD present. And when assessing her her heart during the physical exam, we noticed, no murmur and her PMI was displaced and there was some tachycardia as well. When listening to her lung sounds, we found there was both wheezing and rales. In terms of her extremities, we found, pedal edema and decreased pulses. And in terms of imaging, she had cardiomegaly and palm pulmonary edema on the chest x-ray. When we assessed her two d echo, we found that there was a left ventricular ejection fracture of less than 30%. And in terms of imaging, when it came to the EKG, we found, normal sinus rhythm at 90. There was a left bundle branch block, and there was also, criteria that met left ventricular hypertrophy. Her troponin levels were elevated and her BNP was at 4,000. I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy based off of her lab values and her patient history. Her NYHA classification would put her at, a level of 4 where she cannot carry on physical activity due to her symptoms. And the plan that was, the plan would be to admit her to the ICU because her serious her condition is serious. This would necessitate checking her bottles every 2 hours as well as strict bed rest. And when it comes to the nurse, it requires, a strict intake and out outflow monitoring as well as a daily weight monitoring and also DVT prophylaxis in case her symptoms cause, a clot or an MOS. In terms of her diet, we would prefer her to be low sodium. In IV fluids, we should keep the vein open. In terms of medication, there is no necessity for pain meds. However, for cardiovascular, we should, prescribe clopidogrel, warfarin, and dobutamine. There's no need for diuretics at this moment. And because this is a diabetic patient, it would be best to put her on in the insulin sliding scale. And, again, based off of her oxygen saturation and her increased respiratory rate, I decided to put her on BiPAP. In terms of diagnostic lab orders, PT and INR because of the warfarin and serotroponins to see if there's any change in her, her heart status. And then there is no need for any new imaging at this at this point. However, in terms of consultations, I did recommend an interventional cardiologist. This would be for both in AICD placement as well as a CRTD placement, which could deliver a shock as needed. And that concludes my presentation."
"So Leslie my patient is Leslie Palmer, who's a 62 year old female whose chief complaint is shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient's shortness of breath, began about 2 months ago and has been getting worse. Patient describes feeling fluttering in her chest and, like, she's going to pass out. 3 days ago, the patient presented to her primary care physician where they ordered tests, and her primary care physician then recommended for her to go to the emergency room. Patient states that her symptoms get worse with activity and are better at rest. Patient is currently sleeping in a recliner at night because laying down makes her symptoms worse. On a scale of 0 to 10, patient describes the severity of her discomfort as a 7 or an 8. As far as her social history goes, patient has a balanced diet and walks every day prior to experiencing symptoms. She drinks a cup of cup of coffee every day and is an elementary school teacher who lives with her husband. As far as her past medical history goes, she was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She is up to date on immunizations and has no hospitalizations and no allergies. As far as surgery goes, she had a cardiac catheter 1 year ago and, that was found to have no obstructive coronary artery disease present. For her medication, she's currently on lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day for hypertension, and then her prednisone 10 milligrams once a day for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Patient states that she's compliant with these medications and began the Lisinopril 15 years ago and the prednisone 25 years ago. As far as her family history goes, patient's mother passed away at the age of 40 due to sudden death, and her father passed at age 59 due to a myocardial infarction. As far as, pertinent review of system goes, patient has experienced fatigue, weight gain of £8 over 2 weeks, swelling in lower extremities, near syncope, palpations, wheezing, dysphemia with exertion, and orthopenia. As far as pertinent physical exam, patient has a positive jugular venous detention and no carotid roots, then she has a positive systolic murmur with s 4 and a positive gallop. As far as when listening to her lungs, I heard by basilar rails and wheezing. Looking at her lower extremities, she did have a a DMA in her lower extremities as well as a normal dorsalospetus and posterior tibial pulse. She also does not have any epigastric roots and no pulsatile masses. As far as her abnormal vitals go, she had a heart rate of a 110, a respiratory rate of 20, an oxygen saturation of 91%, and a blood pressure of 136 over 99. For her results of her lab and imaging, her lab work shows that she has an elevated PMP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray shows, cardiomegaly, mediastinal fullness, as well as pulmonary edema. Her echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm and normal access, nonsustained ventricular, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. My leading differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association's, rate rating of 3. As far as the car cause goes, I explained the patient that most likely this is due to the pulmonary sarcoidosis that went to her heart and, resulted in arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. As far as assessment and plan goes, I am admitting the patient to tele telemetry. Sorry. Condition is serious. Allergies, none. Vitals, every 2 hours. She can be out of bed with assistance. As far as nursing interventions go, this would include strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, o two via nasal cannula, as well as maintaining oxygen saturation greater than 96%. A diet of low sodium is also recommended as well as for IV fluids, a saline lock, and keeping the vein open. As far as medications go, I recommend continuing lisinobel to lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily administering in deodorant a 150 milligram IV, increasing prednisone to 60 milligrams once daily, and, adding furosemide 40 milligram IV. Diagnostic labs slash imaging would be, CMP labs. As far as specialists and consults, I recommended interventional cardiologists who discuss the possibility of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator as well as nuclear medicine and radiologists to discuss an FDG PET scan. As far as lifestyle modifications, I recommended to her focusing on a healthy diet, weight reduction, and physical activity when she's cleared by the physician. The patient had no further questions, and, I went ahead and, let her know that her husband could come up and I would explain the information to him. Thank you."
"Where I'm at with miss Palmer, a 62 year old female who presents today with shortness of breath and chest pain. Miss Palmer states that her primary care doctor sat her to the ER, after he evaluated her for her symptoms. 2 weeks ago, miss Palmer had a fever and a cough and has had progressive symptoms since then. She states that her chest pain is currently 2 out of 10. Her shortness of breath is worse with exertion and supine. The patient is alert and oriented, is not febrile today, and 98.6 is her temperature. Her blood pressure is slightly elevated at 130 over 90. She's tachycardiac at 110, and her stats are at 91% with on. Miss Palmer has a hypertension as her medical history, and she currently takes Lisinopril 10 mgs every day. She has had a cardiac cath done 1 year ago, but has no noted obstructive coronary artery disease. She does not have any allergies. And concern to her lifestyle, she's currently a second grade teacher and reports that she exercises twice a week when she feels well. She reports no alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. She has a father with Alzheimer's, a mother who died at 80 from breast cancer. In reviewing her systems, miss Palmer reported recent weight gain of £8, edema in her ankles. She also noted palpitations, chest pain, and wheezing, and was positive for both dyspnea and orthopnea. On physical exam, miss Palmer noted JVD and pitting edema. I did note a left displaced PMI and no carotid or epigastric bruise or murmurs. Brails and wheezing were noted bilaterally on lung cells. I ordered a chest X-ray echo labs in an EKG. On chest X-ray, I noted cardiomegaly and diffuse bulk bilateral pulmonary edema. Her echo indicated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction under 30%, and she had an elevated troponin and BNP. Her EKG indicated tachycardia, left axis deviation, PVCs, and a right bundle branch block. Because of her negative calf 1 year ago and lack of comorbidities, I rolled out coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease, and our family history rolls out sarcoidosis or other inflammatory cardiac conditions. Due to her recent fever, my primary diagnosis is myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA class 2 heart failure. Her condition is serious, and I will have her vitals monitored every 2 hours. I'm going to admit her to telemetry, and I will allow activity as tolerated with a strict INO, daily weights, DVT DVT prophylaxis, and begin oxygen by nasal cannula at 96 until she gets to 96 immediately. I am going to keep her on low sodium and fluid restriction diets. I am going to get an IV, but I'll hold fluids, and I'll reorder a trope and a CNP. I plan to continue her Lisinopril of 10 milligrams, acetaminophen at 625 for pain, rosomide of 40 by IV, and I will consult interventional cardiology due to the possible need for CRT and AICV placement and endocardial biopsy, infectious disease, and also the radiologist for MRI to detect myocardial inflammation. Let me know if you need anything, and thank you."
"To your 2 year old female elementary school teacher who presented today with a 2 month history of shortness of breath and fatigue. She's also been experiencing palpitations and presyncope. It was referred to us after visiting her primary care physician. Her vital signs are heart rate of a 110, a blood pressure of 136 over 99, respiratory rate is 20. Her 2 saturation is 92%, and temperature is 98.6. She has a history of hypertension sarcolysis, which is taking 10 milligrams of Lisinopril and 10 milligrams of prednisone. She has had a previous cardiac catheterization, with no signs of obstructive coronary artery disease. Her family history includes the sudden death of her mother at 40 years old and the death of her father, 59, from a myocardial infarction. Her diet is fairly balanced, and she has she used to exercise regularly until she starts experiencing the shortness of breath. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or any illicit drugs, and her caffeine intake is 1 cup per day, 1 cup of coffee. She has experienced an 8 pound weight gain over the past few weeks along with orthotonia and swelling in her legs. I admitted her for continued cardiac monitoring with daily checks or daily weight checks, oxygen, and, for that to be maintained over a 96% saturation and DVT prophylaxis. I increased her dosage of prednisone to and kept her, Lisinopril dosage the same. She will remain on a low sodium diet and is allowed, activity or movement, with assistance. I added a 150 milligrams of amiodarone and 40 milligrams of furosemide to help with the swelling and ordered a CNP to monitor her potassium levels. I've also gotten consultations to interventional cardiology, for an AICD placement as well as radiology for an FDG PET scan."
"Seeing, mister Leslie Palmer, who's a 62 year old male, who presents today with a complaint of, dyspnea, fatigue, and intermittent palpitation that he's been experiencing for the past couple weeks. He states he's also been experiencing presyncope episodes, but he's not had any syncoponic episodes to date. He states that he experiences his symptoms when he does moderate activities and is unable to to do them without experiencing dyspnea, and he has to rest, or especially laying down helps to relieve his symptoms. His history of hypertension, which is controlled with Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He reports that he's tolerating the medication well. Mister Palmer has a positive history for cardiac sudden cardiac or sudden unexpected death. His mother died at age 40 unexpectedly, and his father died at age 59 due to myocardial infarction. He states that he's never been in the hospital before, but has had a cardiac catheterization 1 year ago. Because his PCP wanted to investigate abnormal EKG findings, the results for the cardiac catheterization was indeed normal, though. He has no known drug allergies. He's currently an elementary school teacher. He would walk daily with his, friends before experiencing, symptoms or exercise. He denies any alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug re the use, and just has him on a cup of coffee. His review of symptoms was positive for wheezing. Also, obviously, palpitations, presyncope, and it was, negative for any lower extremity edema or chest pain, any in the musculoskeletal. The neurological severe symptoms are unremarkable. His, his vitals, showed a blood pressure of 130 over 90, oxygen saturation at 96%, heart rate at 110, respiratory rate was 16, and, temperature was 98.6. Physical exam revealed, no JVD, no carotid or, no carotid or abdominal bruise. There was a positive systolic murmur in s 4 as well as a gallop. No friction rub. The PMI was displaced laterally. The patient had no chest tenderness, and their lungs were cleared auscultation bilaterally. The distal, the stylus, excuse me, the rosales pedis and tibialis posterior pulses were equal and intact. The caffeinon tender Holman sign is negative. No signs of low extremity edema. Yeah, x-ray chest x-ray, build cardiomegaly, BMP, and troponin labs were, normal and remarkable. 2 d echo showed, left ventricular hypertrophy, usual atrial enlargement. The sorry. The EKG revealed, left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria as well as tall r waves in the septal leads, suggestive of interventricular septal hypertrophy and left ventricular hypertrophy. Sinus rhythm normal sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats per minute, but that was the e EKG. Excuse me. Yeah. And so with all of this, in mind, I believe, mister Palmer has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I, recommend to him that we should, not also be New York Heart Association stage 2. I'd recommend it to be admitted to the hospital to telemetry. Yeah. So it's condition serious, get vitals every 2 hours, strict ISO strict IO, daily weight, nasal cannula, oxygen delivery to maintain oxygen saturation 96%. That can be normal activity as tolerated. This discontinues Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and replace it with disopyrimide a 100 milligrams 4 times a day. We'll do IV lock, saline lock, keep the veins open, and no labs or other imaging is warranted at this point due to our consult to the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible septomyomectomy as well or, alcohol injection to reduce the obstructive of of the outflow tract obstruction in the outflow tract, or, and also to the interventional cardiologist to, for a possible AICD placement. With that with that one moment, I think, yeah, miss Palms, ready to see you. Okay. Hopefully, that's it. And, yeah."
"Reported to the ED this morning. She's a 62 year old female with a cheek complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and dull chest pain. She presented to her family medicine physician 3 days ago to be evaluated. She says she had a cold 2 weeks ago consisting of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and fatigue. The symptoms went away 5 days ago but returned, and now she feels worse than before. She continued to go to the gym while she was sick but stopped when her symptoms came back. She noticed that she sleeps in a chair at night because it helps her breathe better. She knows she is comfortable at rest, but has dys dyspnea on exertion and with some exercise and orthopnea. This places her at a New York Heart Association classification of class 2. Her past medical history includes hypertension when she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for. She has no known drug allergies. Her past surgical history includes cardiac catheter 1 year ago that showed no abnormalities. Her mother passed away 5 years ago due to, breast cancer, and her father is currently living with Alzheimer's. She eats a healthy and well balanced diet. And before the symptoms started, she exercised 2 to 3 times a week. She denies any illicit drug abuse, alcohol, and any illicit drug use, use of tobacco products, and, consumption of alcohol. She drinks 1 cup of coffee daily. And she's a 3rd grade teacher, and she's not being updated on her immunizations and having insurance. Her review of symptoms is positive for fatigue, weight gain of £8 over the past 2 weeks, chest palpitations, dull ache and chest pain, wheezing, myalgia, and lower extremity edema. Her physical exams revealed JVD, bibasal rails, PMI displays laterally, one plus pinning edema in her lower extremities and normal radial gersalaspidus and posterior toenial pulses. Her lab demonstrated elevated troponin at point 10 and BNP at 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Her echo demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. Her EKG indicated sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, left axis deviation, and preventricular contractions. Her vitals showed temperature of 98.6, elevated heart rate of 110, elevated respiratory rate of 20, elevated blood pressure of 130 over 90, and her o two was slightly decreased at 91%. So based on her history, exam findings, and the diagnostic workouts, I believe that miss Palmer has a myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association, class 2, which is serious condition. I think the best point of action would be to admit her to telemetry to monitor her vitals every 2 hours. She can proceed with activity as tolerated, and she'd be monitored by nursing for shift IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula to 19 o two stats greater than 96%, and her saline fluid should be KBO, and her diet should be low sodium and food rejection. A 2 day I believe a 2 day echo should be repeated. She should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and begin, or she should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and begin furosemide 40 milligrams IV over 12 hours and acetaminophen 625 milligrams every 6 hours. ACMP and serial troponin should be ordered. A consult with interventional cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology should be conducted to place an I aICD and CRTD, And an endomyocardial biopsy should also be completed. A media enhanced MRI should be completed, and her immuno immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids should be evaluated. And that is the end of my case presentation. Thank you for your time."
"Missus Culmer is a 62 year old woman who presented to the emergency department today with shortness of breath and fatigue. She was in her normal state of good health until about 2 weeks ago when she developed a cough, chest pain, rhinorrhea, and fever, which she described as a cold. 5 days ago, she noticed that while all of her other symptoms had resolved, her chest pain fatigue and shortness of breath had actually gotten worse. So 3 days ago, she saw her family medicine top doctor who recommended today that she come to the emergency department as the chest pain has continued to worsen. She has hypertension for which she's been taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams for 10 years, and a cardiac catheter 1 year ago following an abnormal EKG showed no coronary artery disease. Her review of systems reveals fatigue, 8 pound weight gain in 2 weeks, palpitations, chest pain, wheezing, orthopnea, dyspnea, and lower leg myalgia and edema. Vitals show a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, a respiratory rate of 20, and an sp02 of 91% on room air. She was previously able to go to the gym twice a week, which she is now unable to do without symptoms, which points me to, NYHA class 2. Physical exam showed JVD, laterally displaced PMI, bibasilar rails, and wheezing, as well as point plus 1 lower extremity edema with equal dorsalospetus pulses and nontender calves. She had no cardiac bruise. The lab showed troponin elevated at 0.1 and BMP elevated at 4,000. A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. A two d echo showed ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of less than 30, and an EKG showed a right bundle branch block and a sinus tachycardia. My leading differential diagnosis is myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy in the New York Health Association class 2, Heart Association class 2. I think it's best if we admit her to telemetry and consult interventional cardiology for an AICD or CRTD, infectious disease for immunoglobulin and an endomyocardial biopsy, and radiology for a media enhanced MRI. I would like to start her on IV furosemide 40, 625 acetaminophen PO and continue the 10 milligrams Lisinopril as well as put her on a nasal cannula for o two to get those sats above 96%. This patient would benefit from a low sodium diet with oral restrictions, strict intake, outtake, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and vitals every 2 hours. I walked this patient through these results and our plan, and she had no further questions."
"Mister Palmer today. So mister Palmer presented with, complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue that had been ongoing for the past 6 months. He said that this was kind of just mild for 6 months, and then over the last 3 days, it started progressively worsening. So he went to his primary care physician who ordered a few tests, which he was not sure of the name of. However, when his symptoms significantly worsened today, he called his PCP again who referred him to the emergency department. Patient stated that his shortness of breath is worse with lying flat, and with any type of exertion at all, such as just walking around. And he feels a little bit better when he lays back on an incline. When I walked in the room, his vitals showed a blood pressure of 80 over 50 with an SpO 2 of 86 and a heart rate of, 90 beats per minute. His past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease with a coronary bar coronary artery bypass graft times 3 12 years ago with an additional stent placed, more recently. He remembers having an echo done that showed an EF of about 40% a few years ago. He's currently smoking, 1 pack per day and was at home with his wife. On exam, he had positive jugular venous distension. He was tachycardic with a split s 2 and had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His PMI was displaced laterally, and he had 1 plus lower extremity edema with no associated calf tenderness. After reviewing his results, we discussed that his chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. His EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis deviation and a left bundle branch block, and his lab showed elevated troponin and a BNP significantly elevated at 4,000. His most recent echo that he had done with us showed an injection fraction of 30% and a dilated left ventricle. Given this, I diagnosed mister Palmer with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with plan to admit him to the ICU, reorder his PTINR and seropetrol troponins, and I kept him on clopidogrel, warfarin, lisinopril, and started him on dobutamine as a positive ionotropic agent. I also told him that the interventional cardiologist would be coming by to consult and, discuss AICD CRT placement to also assist with increasing the heart's pumping power, and to consider that as a potential medical device. To conclude, patient had no questions for me and was agreeable with the plan. Thank you."
"I just saw 62 year old male, Leslie Palmer, with the chief complaint of 6 months of fatigue and shortness of breath that has gotten worse in the past 2 weeks, which prompted a visit to his primary care provider. He explains that he has been sleeping in a recliner due to increased shortness of breath while lying down and that he has these symptoms with all physical activity. His past medical history includes AFib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, surgical history of CABG, and 5 cardiac stents to which his cardiologist has recommended no further intervention. History of cardiac disease is a one pack of macularam. Current medications include torvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, Lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin with no known drug allergies. Upon review of this findings, significant findings include fatigue, weight gain of £8 in the last 2 weeks for an unknown cause, wheezing dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema. Vitals, temp was normal, heart rate was normal, and respiratory rate was normal, but the patient was hypotensive with a BP of 80 over 50 and SpO 2 of 86%. Upon physical exam, JVD was present. Gallup was present with split s 2 and tachycardia, as well as PMI displace laterally. There was no respiratory distress or chest wall tenderness, but rails and wheezing were present. Extremities, calves were nontender, but pedal edema was present. Upon imaging, chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. ECHO showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, a left bundle branch block, and LVH criteria. Troponin and BNP were elevated. A primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA functional classification of 4. I'd like to admit this patient to the ICU with serious condition. Vitals check every 2 hours with strict bed rest, strict IO, daily weights, and DVT prophylaxis, as well as a low sodium diet and KVO fluids. Medications, I would like to hold his medications except for clopidogrel and warfarin, and I'd like to add dobutamine IV and insulin sliding scale. Also like to put him on BiPAP to raise that o two and order PTINR and serial troponins. I'd also an interventional cardiologist for possible AICD placement and CRTD placement."
"I had the pleasure of seeing, missus Palmer in the emergency department. Miss Palmer is a 62 year old female, presenting in the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and, chest pain. Her vitals, demonstrated elevated heart rate at 110 and a low o two saturation at 91%. She states that she has had trouble breathing over the past 3 days, and she also reports that she had a cold 2 weeks ago, including, a fever, a sniffle, and some sneezing. She states that her current symptoms are better when she is in her recliner. So she's been sleeping in her recliner, at night to help with these symptoms. When she lays flat, her symptoms are worse, and, her symptoms also worsen with, some daily activities, which would put her at an NYHA classification of class 2. Her other pertinent medical history includes a 10 year history of hypertension, which is well managed on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams by mouth daily. She has no allergies to medications and no history of illicit drug use, no history of alcohol use, and no history of tobacco use. And she eats a balanced diet. And before her symptoms began, she was exercising about 2 times a week, at the gym. And she states that she does have a support system at home and her insurance through work as an elementary school teacher. Her father is 89, and he's living in a nursing home due to his dementia, and her mother passed away at 80 due to breast cancer. Her pertinent review systems, included fatigue and unexpected weight gain of £8 over the last 2 weeks. She has been having chest pain and palpitations, but no presyncity. She has also been experiencing wheezing, orthopnea, and dyspnea, and she has lower extremity. She reports that she has lower extremity edema. Her pertinent physical exam findings included, JVD, jugular venous distension, bibasilar rails, a displaced PMI laterally, plus 1, putting edema in her lower extremities, and normal lower extremity pulses at 2 plus. Her labs demonstrated elevated troponin and BNP, and her chest X-ray chest X-ray demonstrated pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Her cardiac echo showed that she had diabetic or dilated cardiomyopathy with, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. And her EKG indicated that she had sinus tachycardia, at 100 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block. Based on her history, exam findings, and diagnostic workup, I believe that missus Palmer, has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy, due to her recent illness. This is a serious condition, so I think that the best plan of action for her would include admission to the telemetry floor, to monitor her vitals every 2 hours. She can proceed with activity as tolerated, and she should be monitored by nursing for strict ins and outs to daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and she should receive a nasal cannula to maintain her o two saturation above 96%. A two d echo should be repeated, and, she should continue her Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. And she should also be prescribed furosemide, 40 milligrams IV over 12 hours, and acetaminophen, 625 milligrams every 6 hours. A CMP and serial troponin should be ordered, and I would like to consult with, interventional cardiology, radiology, and infectious disease so that she can have an AICD and a CRTD placed. And endomyo endomyocardial biopsy can be performed. She can have a media enhanced MRI completed, and, she can have her immunoglobulins and gluto glucocorticoids evaluated. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. I hope that she feels better soon."
"Alright. So, today, I saw a 62 year old female patient, Leslie Palmer. She was presenting after a follow-up from her primary care 3 days ago with, chief complaint of dyspnea, and this had been going on for about 2 months, with most any activity. She currently is sleeping in a recliner, at night to alleviate her symptoms. She presented with fatigue, an 8 pound weight gain in 2 weeks. She has presyncope, as well as palpitations, and some wheezing was noted. Entering into the room, her vitals, were a little, a little out of the ordinary range, but not too bad. Her heart rate was 110. Respiration rate was, 20. Her blood was 136 over 99, and her o two sat was 91%. So she presented with a history of a heart catheterization a year ago. She has hypertension and has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis for, about 25 years. On her maternal side, there was a history of sudden death, but she presents with no allergies, and, her current medication is 10 milligrams once daily of prednisone and 10 milligrams once daily of Lisinopril. So as I was, going through my physical exam, there are a few pertinent details. She was positive for JVD, but she didn't have any carotid brewery. Her heart rate was regular, but there was an s 4 murmur that was noted. There was no regurge. The PMI was normal placement, and there was no tenderness on the chest wall. Doing a pulmonary exam, there were bilateral raws, and wheezing noted. And there was 1 plus pitting edema, in her lower extremities, but, the pulse was equal and calves were nontender, and there was a negative Homan sign. For her labs, BNP was at 4,000, and there was restricted, cardiomyopathy with a 55% ingestion fraction noted on the echo that was ordered on admission. For EKG, there was normal rhythm. So it's normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, but, there was a non sustained ventricular tachycardia noted in leads, v 1 through 3. So following, her admission into the hospital, I'd like to admit her for, for telemetry, followed up every 2 hours. I'd like to place her on a low sodium diet, with a saline lock as well so we have IV access. I'd like to cons continue her Lisinopril, but add, a 150, IV of amiodarone and increase her, her prednisone, to 60 milligrams, as well as per on furosemide, 40 milligrams IV. And I I'd like to have her on a nasal cannula, with the o two sat greater than 96, doing that with 2 liters of oxygen per minute. Once she's all set up, with telemetry, then I'd like to get a CMP on her and then refer out to interventional cardiology for an AICD placement as well as radiology for an FDG, PET scan."
"Missus Palmer is a 62 year old female that presented today, Pleasant, awake, alert oriented, little bit fatigued, mildly in pain, and with a mildly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. She stated that she had a 2 week history of cold like symptoms that evolved in the last 5 days to chest pain, and limitation of activity like going upstairs, and she's worried that something is wrong with her heart. She states that the chest pain is 2 out of 10, dull, constant, nonradiating, and is better when she leans forward, worse when laying down. VUEA systems revealed fatigue, a recent 8 pound weight gain, wheezing, jugular venous distension, heart palpitations, and lower extremity edema. Patient has a history of hypertension that is well controlled controlled by 10 milligrams of Lisinopril daily. She had a cardiac catheterization 1 year ago, that was normal. Patient's father is 80 years old and has Alzheimer's, and patient's mother died of breast cancer at 79, 5 years ago. She claims a balanced diet, exercised 2 days per week before, her onset of symptoms, no history of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, has one cup of coffee every morning, is a 2nd grade teacher, and is still sexually active with her husband. No known drug allergies. Physical exam revealed a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, 5 basilar rails, and wheezing, lower extremity edema, but nontender calves, negative Homan's test. OMM, exam revealed, no tar changes. Her lab showed high troponin and BNP levels. X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and some premature ventricular contractions. Leading diagnosis is, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, which it's suggested to be taken care of with acetaminophen and furosemide. Staying with her Lisinopril for to control her hypertension. Send to telemetry to be checked on by cardiology for potential CRT or AICD placement, as well as an endo endomyocardial biopsy. Also consider, consulting infectious disease."
"I just finished seeing the patient in room 1. Patient is a 62 year old female who came into the emergency department due to worsening heart palpitations and shortness of breath this morning. The patient has had a history of these symptoms for the past 2 months. And it worsens when she's laying down and upon physical exertion. It does get better, when she rests and when she sits up. The patient also complains of fatigue. So I took her history. The patient has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis. The patient is up to date on all her immunizations. She's currently on Lisinopril 10 milligrams every day and prednisone 10 milligrams every day with no known allergies. Patient has a history of cardiac catheterization 1 year ago, which did not show any coronary artery disease. Mom passed away at 4 years of age, and was a sudden death. Dad passed away at 59 years of age, due to a myocardial infarction. Patient has a regular and balanced diet, and exercises by walking with her friends. However, due to these symptoms symptoms recently, she has been unable to do that. Caffeine around 1 cup a day. No illicit drugs, no tobacco usage, no alcohol usage. She works as an elementary school teacher, and lives with her husband of 30 years. Has insurance. And then I conducted a review of systems. Patient has had unexplained weight gain and fatigue. The review of the skin was, showed no abnormalities. Looking at the, musculoskeletal system, there was lower extremity edema. Patient has felt dizzy at times. HEENT Revere system was negative with no abnormalities. Patient had chest palpitations and pre syncope. There was also, she reported symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea and orthopnea. I looked at the vital signs. The temperature was in normal limit. It was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, was within normal limits. Heart rate was 110, slightly elevated. Respiratory rate, 20, slightly elevated. BP, 136 over 99, slightly elevated, depending on what you look at. O two was 91%, slightly lower than where we want it to be. So then I conducted my physical exam. Patient was positive for, jugular venous distension. Patient had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur, and and there was signs of gallops. The PMI was nondisplaced. I heard, bibasilar rallies. There was wheezing. I confirmed the pitting edema in the lower extremities. Then I looked at the diagnostic findings. Troponin levels were within normal limits, same with everything else except for the BNP. That was, at 4,000, so that was elevated. Chest x-ray, when I looked at it, it just showed some lymphedema lymphadenopathy. Looking at the two d echo, the ventricle, the chambers were non dilated. There was some evidence of some left ventricular hypertrophy. Oh, I meant no left ventricular hypertrophy, but the walls were rigid. I apologize for that. The EKG findings showed, normal sinus rhythm and normal axis, and non sustained left ventricular tachycardia. So that led me to believe that she had, sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. And so because of that, I admitted her to the hospital, so that we can, monitor her. We wanna get vitals every 2 hours. I said, strict ins and outs, check the daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, because of the 91% oxygen saturation. I set up, nasal cannula and, for o two and wanna keep that above 96%. For diet, I have her as, low sodium. Wanna keep the veins open. Lisinum, I'm gonna keep her on the lisinopril 10 milligrams. I wanna bump up her prednisone to, keep the lisinopril 10 milligrams every day. I wanna bump up the prednisone to 60 milligrams every day. I wanna add on amiodarone 150 milligrams by IV and furosemide 40 milligrams by IV. I also, wanna get a consult. I wanna get an interventional cardiologist to come in, talk about maybe some ACID placement. I also wanna get a radiologist in to do a FDT, PET scan, just to further evaluate the patient and look at possible treatments. So let me know what you think. This is the patient room 1, and thank you."
"Pleasure of meeting with Leslie Palmer today. He's a 62 year old male patient presenting with shortness of breath and fatigue. He states his symptoms started about 2 weeks ago while exercising. In addition to his dyspnea and fatigue, he relays he also was experiencing, heart palpitations and pre syncope with exercise. He denies any chest pain. He states that his symptoms were exacerbated with exercise, but were relieved with rest. He's at first saw his primary care physician, after his symptoms began and had some baseline tests performed, but was unsure what those results were. He states that over the last day or so, his symptoms got worse and was advised by his primary care physician to head to the emergency room. He has history of controlled hypertension for the last 10 years, treated successfully with Lisinopril 10 milligrams. He had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago, which, was unremarkable. He states that he had it performed due to an abnormal EKG at his yearly, his yearly checkup. His family history, shows that his mother passed away at age 40 from a sudden cardiac event, and his father passed away at 59 from a myocardial infarction. He also states that he's was experiencing some wheezing, but no history of asthma. He's fatigued, but denies any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss or weight gain. All his other review symptoms were negative, non remarkable. His vitals today were 130 over 90. His heart rate was 1 at about 110. His respiratory rate was at 16, and his o two saturation was at 96%. For his physical exam, he presented with no jugular venous distension or bruise over the cardiac over his carotid arteries or his aortic abdominal artery. He had regular heart rate with a systolic murmur that had an s 4 component. No friction rubbers was present, but he had a gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally. He had no chest wall tenderness, and the rest of his, musculoskeletal exam was normal. His lungs were clear to all auscultation bilaterally, and his osteopathic screen was normal as well. All his labs were normal. There was no evidence of elevated troponin or, BNP. His chest X-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate infiltrate of the fusion, but evidence of cardiomegaly. His 2 d echo showed left ventricular asymmetry left ventricle asymmetric hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement with reserved ejection fracture at about 60%. His EKG showed sinus rhythm, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy criteria, and tall waves and his tall r waves and his septal leads. The patient was admitted to telemetry. His Lisinopril was discontinued, and he was started on dis disopuramide a 100 milligrams 4 times a day. He I discussed with him setting up consults with cardiology to discuss, a pacemaker placement, an automated implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and also discussed, I was able didn't discuss in the room, but went back and put in this note a consult for CT surgery to discuss possible future septal myomectomy and alcohol injections to reviews reduced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Patient was patient was compliant with instructions and processed everything seemed to process everything well. He was alert and oriented. His wife was there, at the ER with him, and he's insured. He's been married for the past 39 years, 35 years. There's no kids. Yes. So that is my case presentation. Let me know if you have any other questions. Thank you."
"Eighty earlier. She was a 62 year old female, missus Palmer. She presented with a dull, constant chest pain, and she noticed she also noted that she was significantly tired and was short of breath. And she said this short of breath and this this lack of breath was more noticeable when walking. She reported a prior illness with fever, cough, and, shortness of breath about 2 weeks ago. She said it subsided about 5 days ago. However, the chest pain remained, and she went to her family care doctor who referred her here. Her past medical history is, positive for hypertension. Her past surgical history was a cardiac press catheterization with no findings. Her mother died of breast cancer in her fifties. Her father is living in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. For her social history, she reports never using alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She is an employed school teacher. Her diet, she's reported, was balanced. She has one cup of coffee a day, and she exercises at the gym twice weekly. Her living situation is that she's with her husband, and they are sexually active. Her current medications are 10 milligrams p o Lisinopril, and she has no known drug allergies. Her review of systems revealed a positive fatigue weight gain. No fever in the office today. However, she, again, claimed that she had one prior. There was no skin changes present. No rash, no bruising bruising, no lesions. She had no headache, no hearing loss, no neck stiffness, no vision changes, and no difficulty swallowing. Her review system for her cardiovascular system revealed, chest pain, that was dull and constant. She was positive for dyspnea, orthopnea, and wheezing. Her musculoskeletal system examination revealed lower extremity edema. She was negative for any neurological deficits. The patient appeared fatigued, but outside of that, no other distress. Her vital signs were 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit for a temperature, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, pulse a blood pressure of 1 30 over 90, and her pulse ox was 91%. Further examination revealed no carotid breweries. JVD was present was present. Her heart was slightly tachycardic. Her her pulse rate, that is. Her respiratory examination revealed wheezing by basilar rails, and no chest wall tenderness. Examination for extremities yielded nontendered calves, bilateral pulses, full and equal, and pedaledema. Her imaging via chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. ECHO 2 d revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG findings were sinus tachycardia with preventricular contractions, and her troponin was elevated. Additionally, her BNP was measured at 4,000, and her overall diagnosis was myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. I gave her a New York Heart Association scale of 2. I admitted her to telemetry. Her with condition serious vitals q two hours. She was given out of bed with assistance for activity, and her nursing interventions were to maintain oxygen saturation at 96%, o two, 2 liters, strict ins and outs with daily weights. I gave put her on a low sodium diet with orders to keep the vein open. I gave her acetaminophen, 6 25 milligrams PO for pain, and I continued her Lisinopril at 10 milligrams PO. Additionally, I gave her metropol succinate 50 milligrams, for the heart failure, and furosemide 40 milligrams via IV for the pulmonary edema and heart failure. I gave prescribed no endocrine medications, no respiratory therapy. I ordered repeat seropetroponins and a repeat 2 to the echo. I referred her to the interventional interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist for potential consult of a AICD pacemaker, a pacemaker, and endomyocardial biopsy. And then, lastly, her EKG revealed a heart rate of 114, again, with PVCs and left axis deviations. That is all I have for you today. Thank you for your time."
"I just wanna present the case to you. Her, the patient's name is Leslie Palmer. She's 62 years old. She is, presenting to the ED today with, a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said her symptoms of fever and cough started 2 weeks ago, which stopped in the last, 5 days ago, but then her chest pain, her shortness of breath, and her fatigue began 5 days into that, and have worsened. She notes having, palpitations as well and dyspnea on exertion with slight activity, and then also said that nothing really helps and that she has orthopnea at night, which causes her to sleep in a recliner. Her fever and cold symptoms have subsided, but, noted that overall, these newer symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, continued on and then worsened. She has a past medical history of hypertension as well as, taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams a day for. She is compliant with her medication and denies having any allergies to medications. She also had a cath 1 year ago, which was due to EKG changes, but noted that, the cath was negative. And then she also has, no. She denies smoking, drinking, or using any drugs, but also, notes that she used to work out at least twice twice a week in the gym, and hasn't been able to lately due to her new symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue. Her overall vitals were a heart rate of a 110. Her pulse ox was normal. Her, o two saturation was a little low at 91 on room air. Her high blood pressure was at 130 over 90, and her respiratory rate was at 20. When I did her physical exam, she did have lower extremity edema. She did not have a murmur, but she did have JVD, no bruise, and her PMI was displaced laterally. When auscultating her lungs, she did have bibasilar rails and wheezing. And then after looking at the labs, there was elevation in her troponin and her BNP. Her troponin was a point one, and her BNP was 4,000. Through the echo, we saw an ejection fraction of less than 30%, and her cardiac X-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. And with her EKG, there was, a right bundle branch block as well as left axis deviation and tachycardia, consistent with her vitals. She notes that she did not take any medication for this, and none of that has helped. Nothing else has helped. And with these results, I diagnosed her with myocarditis myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy, and then let her know that I would like to admit her to telemetry, and to see an interventional cardiologist, to potentially get endocard cardiobiopsy done as well as potentially an AICD, and then to also see an infectious disease specialist because her myocarditis could be a continuation on from that infection 2 weeks ago. So having the infectious disease specialist check on her immunoglobulins would be helpful, and then also to see a radiologist for a more in-depth MRI, on her heart. She was agreeable to all this, and to also change her medications to continue her Lisinopril, but also add on furosemide, for the diuretic, to get rid of that extra fluid in her, and then also acetaminophen, for her pain. So, overall, she was very agreeable to this, to this plan, and, I did diagnose her with myocarditis, dilated my cardiomyopathy."
"I'm here to give a report for missus Palmer. So miss Palmer is a 62 year old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said she was sick sick 2 weeks ago and experienced sniffling, congestion, fever, cough, and chest pain as well as shortness of breath. About 5 days ago, she said her symptoms began to get better, but she continued to have dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue. These symptoms are improved when she rests but are worsened when she begins to exert herself. She's also experiencing orthopnea and is sleeping in her recliner at night. Her chest pain is dull and located in the middle of her chest. Other pertinent, review of systems include lower extremity edema, 8 pound weight gain over the past 2 weeks, palpitations, and wheezing. Her vitals were 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, blood pressure a little elevated at 130 over 90, and her oxygen was at 91%. Physical exam, she had a she had jugular venous distension, displaced PMI laterally. No gallops, shrubs, or murmurs were noted. Negative Hohmann sign, bibasilar rails, and wheezing were also prominent. 1 plus pitting edema of the lower extremity bilaterally with 2 plus pulses bilaterally. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with the two d echo showing, dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle bra right bundle branch block and left axis and, premature ventricular contractions. She has, had an elevated troponin and, BNP of 4,000. Given the information, I believe she has myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA functional classification of 2. I'd like to admit her to telemetry in serious condition. I'd also like to get strict in and outs, daily weights, and start a nasal cannula to maintain o two sat at greater than 96%, as well as beginning DVT prophylaxis. She can continue her Lisinopril, but will start acetaminophen for the pain and furosemide 40 milligrams IV. I also ordered a repeat troponin and CMP. CMP is to monitor the furosemide. She will be referred to interventional cardiology for an AICD or CRTD consult, radiology for media enhanced MRI, and infectious disease as well. Thank you."
"Okay. So Leslie Palmer is 62 year old woman that presents to the ER today complaining of chest pain and dyspnea. Patient stated that they were diagnosed with a viral illness approximately 2 weeks ago by their PCP. At the time of previous illness, the patient had pyrexia, fatigue, palpitations, cough, and wheezing. Approximately 5 days ago, the pyrexia resolved, but they started experiencing arthralgia, myalgia, progressive dyspnea, and chest pain. The chest me the chest pain and dyspnea get better with rest and sitting, but they get worse with moving around in YHA class 2. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were slightly elevated at 130 over 90 and 110 respectively. The o two stat was low at 91%, temperature normal at 98.6. Her troponin was elevated at 0.1 and BNP was also elevated at 4,000. Patient's ROS was positive for fatigue, weight gain of £8 over the last few weeks, arthralgia, myalgia, edema, chest pain, palpitations, cough, and wheezing. The patient had no relevant neuro, h e n t, or skin issues. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which they take Lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day for. They have no known drug allergies. They had a previous heart cath approximately 1 year ago with no pertinent findings, and the patient has not been hospitalized or had any other types of surgery. The patient's mother died of breast cancer approximately 5 years ago, and her father's still alive with Alzheimer's in a care facility. For social history, patient states she has a balanced diet and exercised prior to this viral illness approximately 2 weeks ago, typically going to the gym 2 times a week. The patient reports no drug, tobacco, or alcohol use, and moderate caffeine consumption. Miss Palmer is employed as a teacher but is currently on summer break. The physical exam showed jugular venous distension, bilateral rails, and wheezing. Exam of the lower extremity showed 1 plus pitting edema, no murmurs or bruise on physical exam, and pulses were 2 plus bilaterally. I diagnosed her primarily with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30%, secondary diagnosis of hypertension. The plan is to admit this patient to telemetry under serious condition, get nursing instructions to be vitals q two hours, activity is tolerated, strict dino, daily weights, VVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula to keep oxygen sets around 96% or above, low sodium diet, and to keep veins open. I'd like to continue the Lisinopril 10 milligrams orally and add acetaminophen 6 25 milligrams q 6 hours. I'd like the patient to be on a low sodium diet, and I would like to start patient on furosemide 40 milligrams IV. As far as labs and other tests go, I would like to obtain serial troponins, a CMP, and to repeat the echo. I would also like a biopsy and immunoglobulin testing. For referrals, I would like to see interventional cardiologist for potential CRTD and AICD. I'd also consider doing an infectious disease consult for the myocarditis as well as consult radiology for a potential contrast media enhanced MRI. So again, this patient was Leslie Palmer, age 62, primary diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, secondary diagnosis, hypertension. Thank you."
"Who presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue with onset around 2 weeks ago. Patient reports that his symptoms worsen when he exercise and get better with rest. Patient states that when he exercises, he also begins experiencing palpitations and presyncope. Due to these symptoms, patient reports that he has lost most of his ability to exercise. Therefore, his New York Heart Association functional classification is a 3. Upon onset of cyst symptoms, patient went to his primary care physician for initial evaluation. His primary care physician conducted multiple tests that have not yet resulted. Patient states that his symptoms suddenly worsened yesterday, so he called his PCP and was advised to come to the emergency department. Upon presentation, patient is awake, alert, and a no acute distress. His vital signs include a heart rate of a 110, a blood pressure of a 130 over 90, an o two saturation of 96%, and a temperature of 98.6. Patient is also complaining of maybe wheezing. He states that he feels like he is wheezing, but he doesn't actually know for sure. So he doesn't know if he can say yes, but he doesn't feel comfortable saying no. Patient denies any recent illnesses. The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative. Patient's past medical history includes hypertension for which he takes 1 10 milligram tablet of Lisinopril daily. Patient is compliant with this medication. Patient's past surgical history includes a cardiac cath around a year ago, which according to the patient was normal at the time. Patient's mother suddenly passed away at age 40, and patient's father died at age 59 from a myocardial infarction. Patient reports that he eats a balanced diet, has one cup of coffee per day, and does not drink any alcohol. Patient does not use any tobacco products and denies any illicit drug use. Patient works as an elementary school teacher, and he does have insurance. Patient is married and is sexually active with his partner. Patient has no known drug allergies. Physical exam demonstrated no jugular venous distension, no carotid bruise. Patient's heart was a regular rhythm, and he had a systolic murmur with an s four heart sound. Patient had no rubs, but he did have gallops. Patient's PMI was displaced laterally. He had no chest wall tenderness, and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He had no lower extremity edema. His DP, PT pulses were full and equal bilaterally. He also had no calf tenderness. He had a negative human side. Patient's blood work demonstrated that his troponin and b and p levels were within normal limits. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, but no pulmonary edema or mediastinal fullness. His two d echo demonstrated left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60% and increased intraventricular septum. His EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with LVH voltage criteria and tall r waves in the septal leads. Results demonstrate that the patient has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to his hypertension and his family history. This will require admission because his condition is serious. In the hospital, patient's activity will be as tolerated, and he is able to eat a regular diet. Medication wise, patient will be given disopiramide a 100 milligrams by mouth every day. We will discontinue his Lisinopril. Patient will also require vitals q two hours, keep vein open fluids, strict I and o's, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, and we want to maintain his o two stats at greater than 96%. Consult to interventional cardiologist for an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement and cardiothoracic surgery for septomyectomy and alcohol injection will need to be placed. Patient's wife is in the waiting room and would like to go up to with to would like to go up with the patient if possible. Thank you so much for your time."
"Hey, doctor Smith. So I just got finished seeing miss Leslie Palmer. She's a 62 year old female with a past medical history of sarcoidosis and hypertension who presents to the emergency department today due to worsening fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitation. She said this has been going on for the past 2 months. Initially called her PCP 3 days ago because her symptoms were worsening. I did some labs, and then, she said her symptoms got so bad today that she called her PCP again, and he referred her to the emergency department. He also reports associated weight gain approximately £8 over the past 2 weeks, some wheezing, and some other symptoms such as more extremity swelling bilaterally, some lightheadedness, some orthopnea, which requires her to sit in a recliner when she goes to sleep at night. And a few episodes of near syncope, which she's described as not fully passing out but getting close to it, and lightheadedness as well. She has a past medical history, as I said, of hypertension sarcoidosis, and she said she recently had a cardiac catheterization a few years ago because of an concerning EKG, which came back normal. She has a past family history. It's concerning for her mother who suddenly died at the age of 40, and her father died at 59 years old of a heart attack. She's currently taking Lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day, and prednisone, 20 milligrams, 20 milligrams once a day. She has no known drug allergies. She lives a pretty healthy lifestyle. She's active, walks about 5 days a week, 45 minutes, and her diet is balanced. She has, no alcohol, drugs, for tobacco use. She has, talked about. She currently works as an elementary school teacher, and, she's married to her husband who she lives with. I mentioned all of her pertinent review systems. Everything else was negative. As for her vital signs, she was tachycardic to 110. She was, not hypoxic, but she was borderline with an SPO 2 of 91%. Had a respiration rate of 20 mgsnerticipnik, and then she was mildly hypertensive at 136 over 99, and afebrile. As for vile as for physical exam, she had a JVD as well as one plus putting edema, wheezing, and rails, but everything else was negative. For her labs, she had a negative troponin. She had a negative CBC and CNP, but she did have a bump BNP at 4,000. We also took a look at her EKG, which showed, kind of borderline tachycardia. It was right around a 100, but she also had not sustained SVT, which was concerning. As for her echo, she had increased thickening with an EF of 55%, and it showed up restricted cardiomyopathy, which is concerning for sarcoidosis. Her chest x-ray showed sarcoid nodules, and what I thought to be borderline, cardiomegaly. As for the labs that I think we should go ahead and order, I think we should order another CNP. And I think the plan is to admit her to telemetry with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. I think the plan should be to continue her on lisinopril, but add amiodarone as well as, adding Lasix for volume overload in her lower extremities, as well as, I think we should increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams per day instead of the 20 milligrams per day. I also think we should consult interventional cardiology for a possible AICD, as well as, nuclear medicine or radiology for a, FDG PET scan. I think we should place her on assistance with getting out of bed, vitals q two s, for every 2 hours. And, yeah, I I mentioned getting a lab, a CBC, a CMP, I mean. I don't think any other imaging is necessary except for that, at. Alright. Thank you."
"And today, I saw 62 year old male Leslie Palmer who came to the office today with a 2 week history of fatigue and shortness of breath. He stated noticing these, during exercise. He said, the shortness of breath came on during some exercise and that resting made him feel better as well as laying down helped him to feel better. His vitals when I came in today, he had a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of a 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, a respiratory rate of 16, and o two stats of 96 percent. While gathering his history on him, I realized that he had a past medical history of hypertension, no surgical history. His mother died of sudden cardiac death when she was about 40 years old, and his daughter dad died at 59 years old of a heart attack. For the medication that he was on for his hypertension was Lisinopril, and he had no history of any allergies. After gathering more information on his social history, he described his diet as being balanced. He exercised once a day before he started experiencing the shortness of breath symptoms. He had no history of any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He consumes one cup of coffee a day. He is a school teacher, 5th grade. He is insured. He has a great support system. He lives with his wife, and his immunizations are up to date. After that, I continued on with his review of systems in which he described being fatigued, having chest palpitations, feeling like he was going to pass out, having dyspnea, and wheezing, as well as feeling dizzy. Upon presentation, the patient seemed to be awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued. From there, I continued on with physical exam in which I found no, JVD or carotid breweries. He had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur with an s 4 sound. He had no chest wall tenderness, and his PMI was displaced laterally. His lungs were clear also stationed bilaterally, and he had no edema or swelling in his lower extremities. His pulses were equal and bilateral, and his calves were not tender. After looking through his results, his x rays showed some, cardiomangly. His echo had some asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with tall r waves in the septal waves and, left ventricular hypertrophy. His troponin and his BNP were both within normal range. So I came up with a diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to his past history with his mom and his dad both having cardiac issues. I determined him to be a New York Heart Association class 2, with limitations in some some activity. I would like to admit him to telemetry and stop his Lisinopril, start him on disopyrimide, and we would like to consult interventional cardiology to see if they would like to place an AICT device as well as consult cardiothoracic surgery to see, if he would be a good candidate for an alcohol injection or a septomyectomy. As far as his nursing things, I would like his vitals to be done every 2 hours. His activity can be as tolerated. I want him on strict input, output, daily weight, o two nasal cannula for about 2 liters per minute, and I would like to maintain his oxygen stats above 96% as well as through DVT prophylactic prophylaxis. Patient was feeling okay about his diagnosis and felt like he was in good hands. And his wife was going to come up with him, and they were going to get ready for him to be admitted. Thank you."
"Mister Palmer is a 62 year old male that presented to us today with a chief complaint of fatigue and, palpitations that have been going on for the last 2 weeks. As far as his, history goes, the only additional thing is that he's also been experiencing experiencing near syncope with the with the palpitations and fatigue. He says that this is this only occurs as he's performing activity like his his walks that he takes every day. It's only past medical history that's pertinent is a history of hypertension however he does have a history of sudden death in the family his mother died at 40 of unknown causes. Dad died of an MI at 59. Only medication he's taking is 10 milligrams of Lisinopropia daily. No allergies, and no substance use. He does drink 1 cup of coffee a day. In addition to that, his as far as his activity, it's it's great. He said that he hikes almost 3 to 4 miles daily with a group of friends, and this this issue has been keeping him from doing that. As far as physical exam goes, he, did not have any JVD or peripheral edema, but he did have a systolic murmur with s 4, and a laterally displaced PMI. Overall, this patient's major presenting problem is fatigue. My differential diagnosis included, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, sarcoidosis, myocarditis, and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I think given this patient's family history and his his immediate past medical history as well as the tests that we ordered, the echo, the EKG, the chest x-ray, and the, the lab work are all, are all in line with with HOPIM being the leading diagnosis. As far as a plan for this patient, I think that, we should start them on, desopiramide, discontinue Lisinopril, and consult interventional cardiology for defibrillator placement and cardiothoracic surgery for either myectomy or a septomyectomy or an alcohol ablation."
"I'm here to give the case presentation on the patient I just saw. Patient presents with shortness of breath and fatigue starting 2 months ago. Patient states that it gets worse with activity and gets better with rest, but the patient cannot lay flat or else she gets source she has short of breath. She needs to sleep in her recliner at night. The patient's past medical history is hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. And for the hypertension, she's on Lisinopril, and she's also on prednisone. Patient stated that she had a hard cath a year ago. The patient does not take does not drink any alcohol, does not smoke tobacco products, or take illicit drugs. The patient states that she has palpitations, and she feels like she's gonna pass out. The patient amidst a fatigue and 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and leg edema. The patient had an X-ray ball work, echo done, recently, and we went over that with the patient. Based on the findings and past medical history of the patient, I would like to admit the patient to telemetry. And while admitted, I would like to put in consults to interventional cardiology and radiology. I would like to see if they would wanna do a AICD, and I would like to get another PET scan on her. Additionally, I would like to put her on IV furosemide, and because of that, we should get another CMP on her just to make sure her blood work is fine. My diagnosis is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thank you."
"I'm going to present about mister Leslie Palmer who prevent who presents with the chief complaint of shortness of breath at rest and fatigue that has been gradually worsening over the past 6 months. He has a history of cardiovascular problems, including CABG and cardiac stent. He has experienced unintentional weight gain of £8 over the last few weeks. He has lower extremity edema, and he experiences wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. His his other current medical problems include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Afib. For medication, the patient takes metformin 500 milligrams BID, furosemide 20 milligrams BID, Clopidogrel, 75 milligrams QD. Warfarin, 2.5 milligrams BID. Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams QD. Metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams QD. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams QD. Patient is a current 1 pack per day smoker, and has been for the past 30 years. On physical exam, jugular venous distension was noted along with wheezing, bibasilar rails, and lower extremity edema. Patient had tachycardia with a split s 2 and displaced PMI laterally. Troponin and BNP are elevated. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed no normal sinus normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Heart rate is 90, blood pressure is 80 over 50, and oxygen is at 86%. Based on the physical exam and the history, patient has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Patient is to be admitted to the ICU with with interventional cardiology consult for CRTD and AICD placement. All meds should be discontinued except for the patient's warfarin and clopidogrel, and dobutamine IV drip will be added, as well as the insulin sliding scale. Patient will be given BiPAP oxygen, and nursing interventions will be given as well. Labs to be ordered include serial troponins and PTINR. Thank you."
"Just got finished meeting with miss Leslie Palmer, a 62 year old female elementary school teacher. She presented today with dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. Her vitals were 80 over 50, pulse 90, 86% oxygen, respiratory rate 22, and temperature of 98.6. She did not have a fever. She had an 8 pound weight gain with lower extremity swelling. She did not have syncope, and she did complain of wheezing and dyspnea at rest. Her immunizations are up to date. Her symptoms started 6 months ago and progressively got worse. She is not currently in any pain. Her medical history is significant for a triple bypass and 5 stents. The most recent stent was 1 year ago for, the left anterior descending artery. The cardiologist, said that, she has had the maximum number of stents at this point, and she currently has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Her family history is significant for breast cancer on the maternal side. Her mother passed away at the age of 80, and her father is still alive at 89 years old with Alzheimer's living in a facility. Excuse me. She is currently a smoker, 30 pack years. A balanced diet. She used to walk before her symptoms started getting to her regularly, and she only has a cup of coffee every day. No alcohol. No drugs. No tobacco. No. Plenty of tobacco. Yeah. Sorry. Her current medications include Lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metformin, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, and warfarin. Her lab values showed a elevated troponin and elevated BNP. Her troponin was 0.0 or BNP was 4,000. Her chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema, and her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. Upon physical examination, I noticed that she does have jugular venous distension. No bruise. She did have tachycardia with a split s 2, and, her PMI was displaced laterally. Wheezing was present and rail as well as rails, and a plus one peripheral edema was present, and her pulses were were present bilaterally. So we sent her to the ICU. We kept her on her clopidogrel on her warfarin, put her on an insulin sliding scale and dobutamine, and we consulted an interventional cardiologist for an AICD and a CRTD."
"The doctor saw that clinic. She complains of shortness of breath of 2 months duration, and she states that, that is her chief complaint. And she states that she visited her primary care physician 3 days ago as a result of her symptoms. She also complains of lettering of chest. She states that this has an ongoing character and has not been caught within over the past 2 months. On top of this, she states that this, shortness of breath is worse when lying down in Jacob. On top of this, she ultimately claims that she experiences dips down upon an attempt at physical activity. She rates her symptom severity as 0 to 10 whenever she is in an upright position and not engaged in physical activity. She also reports a weight gain of 8 pounds here recently. And she also reports fatigue, palpitations, flutters, near syncope, and lower extremity edema. Other review of systems were negative. She had a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a blood pressure a blood pressure of a 136 over 99, and a respiratory rate of 20. Her oxygen saturation was 91, and her temperature was 98.6, degrees Fahrenheit. She had a prior history of hypertension and lung sarcoidosis. She has known on drug allergies. She has a prior surgical history of heart, heart catheterization. She's never been hospitalized. Her father died of a heart attack. Her mother died of sudden unknown death. And she is currently placed on 10 milligrams Lisinopril and 2 milligrams of prednisone. A point patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of findings of non sustained ventricular tachycardia on EKG. Also findings of heart failure on chest x-ray and echocardiogram. Hopefully, she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis with, restrictive cardiomyopathy. She will be admitted to telemetry as a result of her diagnosis. Her condition is serious. Vitals will be attained every 2 hours. She will be permitted out of bed with assistance. She'll be on strict IO, daily weight monitoring, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula. We wanna make sure that our oxygen saturation remains above 96%. Should we have low low sodium diet? Should we give an IV fluid saline? We will continue her on her lisinopril. We will also prescribe amiodarone, and, we'll also refer her to interventional cardiologist for AICD placement to prevent irregular heart rhythm. On top of this, we will prescribe her first line to help with her excess volume. We'll also increase her doesipredisone to help, with, blunting being immune response to the cardiac sarcoidosis. Additionally, she will be referred to radiologists for specific PET scan to monitor her condition. And I believe that is it for this patient. We will continue to follow-up with her."
"She is a, she is a 62 year old female that comes in complaining of shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Started about, 2 months ago. But discomfort and shortness of breath comes and goes, but it gets worth worse with exertion and lying down. That's why she says she sleeps on a recliner. She feels tired and says she has flutters in her chest, which I believe are palpitations. Past medical history, she has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoid, which she has been taking prednisone 10 milligrams daily for, 25 years. She also takes Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. She has, no known drug allergies. Past surgical history, she just had a cardiac cath, 1 year ago. Vitals, everything is, fine except for heart rate, which is at 110, blood pressure 136 over 99, and sp02 at 91, which is a little bit low. Family history, mother died of a sudden sudden death at 4 years old, and father died of a MI at 59. There's no permanent, social history, but she does live with her husband, which she wants us to get after we admitted her. A review of systems show that, for general, there's fatigue and weight gain. For CVS, review of systems, there's chest discomfort and flutters, which are, chest, which are cardiac palpitations, and there's presyncope symptoms, which, she said were, shortness of breath and tiredness. So for CVS, she had discomfort, palpitations, and presyncope symptoms. Pulmonary review of symptoms, she had wheezing and dyspnea and also arthopnea. Physical exam showed overall. She looks fatigued. No carotid bruvies, but we did find JVD. There's a murmur present in the heart when I was doing a, heart exam. There was wheezing and rales during the lung lung exam as well. Pulses were equal, but her leg did have edema. We went over the lab test with her, and, chest, x-ray showed there was some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, but most noticeably, there is a sign which is indicative of sarcoidosis. Echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and also a dilated atrium. Ejection fraction was at 55%. EKG showed nonsustained, ventricular, tachycardia. Troponin was within normal limits, but the labs that were high were BNP at 4,000. So after, talking to the patient, getting her history, review systems, physical exam, and lab test. She, she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis. So she had, sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy of, New York Heart Association criteria 3. I've talked with, miss Palmer, and she was admitted to telemetry in serious condition. Orders were vitals every 2 hours. She wanted to get out of bed. There was out of bed assistance, strict IO, daily weights, maintain o two at 96. I know hers is at 91 right now. There was, an order for DVT prophylaxis, keep veins open, KVO, and also, just put her on a low sodium diet. The meds that were ordered for her was to be kept on Lisinopril, that she's already taking 10 milligrams, once a day, up the dose of prednisone, to 60 milligrams a day, for her now cardiac, sarcoidosis. Before it was the 10 milligrams for the pulmonary sarcoidosis. So yeah. So, up the prednisone dose to 60 milligrams and also add 150 milligrams of IV amiodarone for her arrhythmia, the, non sustained ventricular tachycardia, and also 40 grams of furosemide, IV was ordered for her. As a follow-up, to admit, she was ordered to see a cardiologist for an ACID and also, a radiologist for a FDG PET scan for her sarcoidosis."
"Hi, doctor Rollins. Today, I'm here to talk to you about 62 year old Leslie Palmer who entered the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and, chest pain while going on walks with his friends. Mister Palmer has a history of receiving a cardiac cath by recommendation from his previous PCP. He has hypertension, and he's currently taking 10 milligrams of Lisinopril. Important family history. His mother did die suddenly at the age of 40, from unknown causes, and his father died from an MI at the age of 59. In terms of his social history, he has a balanced diet. He likes to regularly exercise before his symptoms started where he went on regular walks with friends. He has a cup of coffee about every morning, and he's been happily married for his to his wife for about 30 years, and they live together. Currently, he is also still working as an elementary school teacher. So in terms of his presentation, like I said, he presented with shortness of breath. He reported fatigue and wheezing and dyspnea. He was experiencing palpitations and presyncope. However, he did not present with arthopnea. His vitals were pretty good. The only thing was that he was a little tachycardic, at 110, but his temperature and his o two steps, and everything seemed, were also within normal range. In terms of his physical exam, no GVD, no bruise, or anything like that. He had a regular heart rate. He did appear with a systolic murmur with an s 4 and a gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally suggesting that he had cardiomegaly, which became apparent when we looked at his chest X rays. His lungs were clear to auscultation, so nothing to worry about there. No edema, full pulses, calf wasn't tender, so that falls in line with no, edema as stated before. When looking at his lab work, his troponin and BNP was perfectly fine. His chest X-ray did show cardiomegaly. His echo showed, left ventricle asymmetric ejection fraction of 60%, and his, and an increased, thickness of his septum. His EKG was normal sinus for them. He did have signs of, LVH, voltage criteria. And more importantly than not, he did have tall r waves in his septal leads. So this led me to conclude along with his history that he has familial restrictive cardiomyopathy. Because of that, I told him that I would like to admit him into the hospital, and keep him on a monitor. I recommended that we discontinue his Lisinopril and started him on desupuramide a 100 milligrams instead. That way we can monitor for any, arrhythmias or any kind of problems in case that happens. I recommended a consult with interventional cardiology to look at the placement of an AICD as well as a consult to cardiothoracic surgery for, a septomyectomy or an alcohol injection for him. So thank you."
"62 year old male, he presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Onset, patient stated that he felt he's been feeling this way for the last 6 months, and it's progressively gotten worse. Within the last 3 days, he's gotten really fatigued, and he contacted his, PCP, who told him to come to the emergency department today. Patient stated that he feels a general sense of fatigue. There isn't a location or a character descriptor for his pain because it's just fatigue. Nothing seems to help make it better or worse, and it's been happening for the last 6 months. As I stated, it doesn't go anywhere, for timing, the past 6 months. I asked the patient to rate it from a scale of 0 to 10. Patient stated that it was an 8 to 9. His symptoms feel about 8 to 9 out of 10. And as far as surgical history, his patient stated that, 12 years ago, he had a 3 3 vessel CABG, as well as 5 stents within the last 5 years, one stent each year. He stated that a surgeon told him that he's got 40% ejection fraction. For his medical history, patient's got hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and Afib. He's not allergic to any medication. He is on a list of medications. He's on Lisinopril. He's on metformin. He's on, I believe he was on metoprolol. He was on clopidogrel. He was on warfarin, and, might be 1 or 2 more medications for his, for his past medical history. As far as hospital his hospital utilization, patients stated that he was hospitalized once, and that was mainly during, his open heart surgery for the three vessel CABG. Family history includes paternal Alzheimer's. Patient's father is still alive, but he has Alzheimer's in a nursing facility. Maternal side, patient's mother, is deceased, due to breast cancer. And, for social history, patient's food intake is adequate and he's got a balanced diet. Exercise is not adequate. Patient stated that he gets fatigued doing any sort of physical activity for the last 6 months, so he has not been keeping up with exercise. No use of drugs. Patient is a 1 pack per day smoker for the last 30 years. No alcohol consumption. Occupation, patient is a school teacher, and, living situation or living arrangement is, he's a he lives with he lives with his family. As far as ROS, he had patients stated that he has fatigue, as well as gaining 8 pounds within the last, 2 weeks. No skin lesions, no abnormalities. No abnormalities with any h e n t, problems. For cardio for cardiovascular, no problems there too. For pulmonary, patients stated that he has wheezing. He's also the dyspnic, as well as orthopnic. Patients stated that he cannot lay flat and usually has to sleep upright. For MSK, nothing to report. For neuro, nothing to report. Physical examination, we called positive JVD, no carotid bruise. Tachycardia split as 2, no murmurs, but has gallops, Rally's, and wheezing. Patient also had edema. Pulse was full and equal, and patient did not have a tender calf. As far as the results show, patients with EB and were both elevated. Chest x-ray revealed cardiometally with pulmonary edema. And, EKG showed left bundle branch block or changes from the past changes from his past EKGs. The the echo revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. Ejection fraction right now is about 30%. Patient was counseled. He was diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the results support that. Physical examination support that. The vitals were blood pressure 80 over 50. Heart rate was 90. Respiratory rate was 22, temperature was 98.6, and, SPO 2, I believe, was 86%. So due to his previous history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and his atherosclerosis, his stents, his cardiac disease, we decided to admit him to the ICU. The treatments included, discontinuing clobidogrel and warfarin and in initiating the dopamine therapy to bump up the blood pressure. And, we were consulting with, interventional cardiology, as well as having the patient admitted to the ICU, try to elevate his blood pressure. So that was the plan. Patient was has all all immunizations in record, and, that's about it for my case presentation. Thank you."
"Good morning. So the patient today is missus Palmer. She is a 62 year old female who presented to the emergency department with a 6 month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. The fatigue is constant. It's not brought about by exercise. It doesn't go away with rest. Past medical history, she's been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She's had a triple bypass, and she's also had 5 cardiac stents placed. She is an active smoker, one pack per day for about 30 years currently. She's employed as an elementary school teacher. Regular diet caffeine, is normal. No alcohol. She lives with her husband, and she does walk daily. She has noticed other than the gradual onset fatigue, she has had an a weight gain of about £8, which I believe is due to lower extremity edema. She did say that she has noticed some extra swelling in her legs. She also had noted wheezing and shortness of breath as well as, she needs a sleep in a recliner at night in order to get comfortable. Upon presentation, she was hypotensive. Her blood pressure was 80 over 50. Her heart rate was 90, which is some borderline tachycardic. Respiratory rate's 22, which was slightly low, and her oxygen was 86%, which was very low. On physical exam, jugular venous extension was present. She was tachycardic. Her PMI was displaced laterally. On auscultation, there was wheezes present as well as rails in her lungs. Cardiac auscultation, there was no murmur, no friction rub, no gallop. There were positive, findings for pedal edema on the physical exam. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well as the 2 d echo showing dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. Troponin was elevated. BMP was over 4,000. Overall, the final diagnosis and assessment was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She was continued on, she's continued on clopidogrel, clopidogrel, and warfarin, as well as adidobutamine because she was hypotensive. Because we continue your clopidogrel and her warfarin, we would we need to do a PT and t PTT INR, as well as a consultation with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement and a CRTD placement. She'll be admitted to the ICU with the New York Heart Association classification of 4, given that she's on strict bed rest in serious condition, vitals every 2 hours, strict IO, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, as well as keeping the vein open for IV access. She had no questions at this time. Understood the plan and where to go from there. Perfect. Thank you very much."
"A 62 year old male presenting for, light headedness, feeling faint, shortness of breath, feeling raspy, wheezing, and a flutter in his chest. These symptoms come on with activity and have been, popping up for the past 2 weeks with activity onset. He says that it has disrupted majority of his daily activities, and this is the first time this has ever happened to him. He does say symptoms does only get relieved with rest. Patient has a past medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. He also had a catheterization 1 year ago due to an abnormal EKG. Patient denies getting an echo done before in his life. The patient is prescribed Lisinopril 10 milligrams that he takes for his hypertension and also reports taking a multivitamin. Patient has no known drug allergies, no previous surgeries or hospitalizations, immunizations up to date. Past medical, family history is that his mother died of age at age 40 due to a sudden cardiac death, and father died at age 69 due to an early MI. Patient denies any illicit drug use, tobacco, or alcohol use. Patient, reports that before symptom onset would exercise 3 to 4 times a week for 45 to 60 minutes at a time. He is sexually active because and he is married with one partner, and they live together. And he also is a school teacher for 7th grade. Patient is positive for fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, wheezing, dyspnea, and lightheadedness slash dizziness. Upon a vital review his vitals, showed a heart rate of 110, blood pressure of 130 over 90, and also O2 sat of 96. His physical exam revealed a jugular venous distension, a laterally displaced PMI, wheezing, and plus 1 bilateral, lower extremity pitting edema. Labs revealed, troponin and BNP to be within normal limits, along with the rest of the panels. The chest x-ray reveals cardiomegaly, and echo revealed an objection fraction of 60%, along with left ventricular asymmetry and the thickening of the septum. And the EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and tall r waves in the septal leads. So Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a New York, scale of 3 due to his inability to maintain majority of his, normal activities. Patient was admitted to telemetry and activity as tolerated. Nurse intervention orders, were strict i's and o's, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula, and to maintain oxygen sats above 96%. He was also ordered, a regular diet and for IVs, to be KVO. He was discontinued on Lisinopril and has now been prescribed disopuramide 100 milligrams per oral. We sent referral to a cardio interventional cardiologist for AICD placement assessment as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon for assessment for a septal myectomy or alcohol injection. Patient reports having financial stability and insurance to proceed to the hospital for care and has a strong social and emotional support at home. And we reported that, upon, discharge from the hospital to maintain healthy diet habits, physical activity, and to refrain from strenuous activity until a physician clears and gives the okay."
"Was a 62 year old male named, Leslie Palmer. Mister Palmer was coming in for complaints of shortness of breath and, fatigue. He said that it started about 6 months ago that but has been increasing, and then over the last 3 days, that has become significantly worse. He does he declined any, he's not any pain, and stated that he's been sleeping in his chair, his recliner, and not for relief. He he said that he does have symptoms at rest and that nothing has been making it better, so I would say that he was, he's on the NYHA scale as a 4 with, symptoms at rest. He has a significant past medical history, for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and, paroxysmal AFib. His medications include, metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams, Lisinopril 10 milligrams, atorvastatin 10 milligrams, metformin 500 milligrams, furosemide 20 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, and warfarin, 2 and a half milligrams. His surgical history includes the CABG 12 years ago, and then he also, has had 5 stents put in, over the past 5 years with the last one being a year ago. Cardiology told him that he was no longer a candidate for anymore, so that was the last one that he had. He has no known drug allergies. Social history is significant for a 30 year history of smoking, 1 pack per day, and, he's caffeine positive. He's married. Denies any alcohol or drugs. He is an elementary school teacher. 2nd grade. Family history, some notable things. His mother died of breast cancer about 5 years ago at the age of 80. His father is still living, but he is in a memory unit with Alzheimer's disease. On review of systems, some significant findings was that he was very fatigued. He has had a weight gain of around £8 over the past 2 weeks. He did have lower limb edema. He had wheezing. He had dyspnea, and then he, was positive for orthopnea. On physical exam, his vital signs were as as follows. His heart rate was 90. O two stat on room air was 86%. BP was 80 over 50. Temp was 98.6, and his respirations rate were 22. So, we were keeping, especially a close eye on the o t o two stat and the, his blood pressure. On the actual physical exam, he did have he did, test positive for JVD. No carotid bruise were heard. He was tachycardic with a split s 2 on auscultation. His, PMI was displaced laterally. He did he did not have any chest tenderness, but he did have the presence of wheezing and, bilateral rails on auscultation. Going down his legs, he did have one plus pitting edema, and all pulses, all peripheral pulses were good and equal. On his lab result, it showed that he did have an elevated troponin of 0.04, and his BNP was very elevated at, 4,000. Chest x-ray was significant for cardiomegaly and also, showed signs of pulmonary edema. His two d echo showed that he did, have dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30, so very reduced. EKG, did have a normal sinus rhythm. There it looked to me like maybe some AFib on the bottom, which he did say that he was diagnosed with, and a, left bundle branch block. There was also on the EKG, criteria that met for left ventricular hypertrophy. So after I went all over this with him and talked to him, stated that I I believe that he had, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and that we were going to admit him to the ICU. His condition would be serious. He would be on strict bed rest. Some orders for the the nursing staff was to, have strict ins and outs, daily weight, and, DVT prophylaxis. For his oxygen, did order a BiPAP, 16 6 or f I o two 50% to try to get his oxygen back up. We're gonna keep him on a low sodium diet. IV fluids, we none were indicated at the time, so we're just gonna keep him KBO. On the meds, rush can put a hold on everything except the, clopidogrel 75 milligrams in his warfarin, 2 and a half milligrams, but we are gonna add, dobutamine, high b drip, and then have him on the insulin sliding scale. Labs, we're gonna repeat the troponins and make sure they don't continue to go up. So we're gonna do some serial troponins, and then we're also gonna keep an eye on his, PT, PTT, INR to make sure that his blood isn't getting too thick. And then for consults, I told him that he would be meeting with the interventional, right, cardiologist for, they would discuss possibly implanting devices. So the CRTD and the AICD, to help with dysrhythmias and to help his heart, do better. So some lifestyle modifications that, I didn't mention with him was, you know, we can promote a healthy diet. We can talk to him about smoking cessation, and I think just maintaining those things would be beneficial. So, yeah, I think that he will do well if we get him in and get him taken care of, get a couple of maybe devices in to help with his heart. If we keep his AFib under control and, maintain his other comorbidities, I think that he will do well. So thank you."
"This patient is a 62 year old male who presents to the emergency department, with a 6 month duration of shortness of breath. He states that for the past 30 days that his shortness had breath of breath had increased. And as a result, he went to see his primary care physicians today. The primary care physician went ahead and sent him over to the ER, for that shortness of breath. And he now presents with, shortness of breath that is worse with lying down and exacerbated with any form of activity. He states that he has a previous history of diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and he previously had a CABG operation 12 years ago. And 5 years ago he had a stent placement every year for the last 5 years. Patient states that his mother died from breast cancer at the age of 80 and his father is currently alive. He has Alzheimer's and is in a current care facility. Patient states that he has gained £8, in the last 2 weeks. He states that he has a wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, but he denies any syncope, chest pain, syncope, chest pain, or, cough. He also states that, he has a good diet, relatively healthy, but minimal physical activity due to his symptoms. He also addresses that he is a, smoker. He has smoked one pack per day pack per day for, the last 30 years, and he currently takes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams, atorvastatin 10, milligrams, and metformin 500 BID. He also takes furosemide 20 milligrams as well as clopidderol 75 milligrams, warfarin 2.5 milligrams, twice a day. While I evaluated him, his labs showed that he had an elevated troponin and BNP, and that his chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly as well as, pulmonary, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. He also, had an echocardiogram which shows decreased, wall movement as well as dilated cardiomyopathy. Based on these findings oh, sorry. The physical exam results also showed that he's oriented, fatigued, oriented to time and place oriented alert to time and place as well as fatigue. His, pulmonary exam revealed that he has bibasilar reals and wheezing, but no and a positive gallop, but no rubs, no murmurs, and also his PMI is displaced laterally. On examination, he also had bilateral putting edema, and he had no neurological findings. His h, he had positive GVD and his skin findings were negative as well. Based on these results, I went ahead and diagnosed him with dilated ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. He and, placed orders to admit him to the ICU. He has an NYHA scale of 4. He has, with vitals q two hours, strict bed rest, and a strict INO, daily weight with DVT prophylaxis. He's been put on a low sodium diet, and, he all of the meds have been held except for clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, DID dobutamine IV drip, and an insulin sliding scale. I'll also go ahead and put in orders for BiPAP 16 out of 6 on, FIO2, 50%. Diagnostics, I'm going to go ahead and order troponin's PTINR and then go ahead and put in a consult with the interventional cardiologist for CRTD and ice a a c AICD placement."
"Good morning. My patient today is, was a 62, I believe, year old male. And, he came in complaining of tiredness and shortness of breath. And the first time he had, felt these symptoms was about 2 weeks before while on a walk with friends and regular exercise, and these walks with friends is, a normal part of his lifestyle. And, so he experienced that shortness of breath and tiredness precipitated by that walking exercise. And it continued to worsen every time he exercise, every time he went on a walk. So he visited his primary care provider, his, family medicine doctor about 3 days before presenting here at the emergency room. And, the family practice doctor ran several tests, ran an EKG. Everything came back negative, so he referred, the patient to us at the ER. And as I mentioned, this patient, any activity that's ordinary physical activity. So exercise resulted in this fatigue and shortness of breath. And when I'm going over his review of symptoms, general beyond the fatigue, excuse me, came back negative as well as the the skin, the h e e n t, and the musculoskeletal. But in the looking over cardio, in addition to the breathlessness, he also had palpitations and has nearly passed out several times, but has never fully passed out. We experienced syncope there our presyncope there, if I may correct myself. And he also experienced wheezing and dyspnea in his pulmonary. When going over his family history, the most pertinent information was he had a mother mother who suddenly died at the age of 40 with, no medical explanation ever given and a father who died of a heart attack at the age of 55. He has hypertension, and his past surgical history was the cardiac cath that I believe he might have received at his family practice visit. But, no, beyond that, healthy, he's on Lisinopril 10 milligrams for that hypertension. So when I went over my physical exam, generally, I I when listening to his heart and lungs, several things came up. Mainly that being the palpitations, there was a murmur present. There was also a displaced point of max maximal impulse laterally, and I heard that wheezing, when listening to the lungs. But the lower extremity, osteopathic, everything else about the physical exam came back normal. And when we got his labs back, everything was negative, including troponin and, the natriuretic peptide. His chest X-ray came back showing no pulmonary edema, but cardiomegaly. There's a large, increased silhouette present, and his echo came back with left ventricle asymmetric injection fraction of 60%. And in his EKG, there was clear tall r waves in the septal leads, and it fit the left ventricular ventricular hypertrophy criteria. So this patient is diagnosed with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an NYHA 2 classification, and this is secondary to his hypertension. So I admitted him to telemetry. His condition is serious. I ordered vitals to be taken every 2 hours. He has no known drug allergies allergies activity as tolerated. For his nursing instructions, strict input output, taking daily weight, TBT prophylaxis, o two via a nasal cannula, and maintaining oxygen above 96%. He could be put on a regular diet. I also ordered IV fluids via saline lock, and importantly for medications to discontinue his Lisinopril, but initiate, disopyrimide a 100 milligrams, QID. No. I didn't order any diagnostics or imaging, but I did refer him to interventional cardiology for AICD placement. And I also referred him to cardi cardiothoracic surgery for a possible, future septal myomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce that, left ventricular obstruction. And his vitals, if I forgot to mention, were, a 110 heart rate, 96% oxygen, a 130 over 90. And for, blood pressure, and 98.6 temperature. Thank you."
"I have a patient, Leslie Palmer, 62 year old female or 60 year old male that presents the emergency room today, complaining of syncopal episodes and shortness of breath happening gradually over the last 2 weeks. This patient is comfortable at rest. He says that physical activity with his friends, normally around 3 to 5 miles, has not been able to happen due to undue breathlessness. He also states that he's been having palpitations and has nearly passed out several other times. He has a hypertension in his past medical history. He's had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago. No evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease and, his past family history. He his mother died from a sudden cardiac death, and his his dad died from a, cardiac, myocardial infarction. Social history, he doesn't doesn't smoke, doesn't drink. He's a elementary school teacher, has balanced diet, and he takes Lisinopril 10 milligram, once a day. This patient also presented, with no headache or no fever, no chills, no general constitutional symptoms. Main symptoms were cardiovascular. He has palpitations. He has near syncopal episodes and but no chest pain. Lung wise, he has no orthopnea, but he does have dyspnea on exertion. He does have wheezing. Patient doesn't have any edema. And on physical exam, we did not notice any lower extremity edema. No jugular vein, distension. Pupils were eagle around and reacted to light. No issues with, his labs. The troponin and the BNP were normal. The Chex's x-ray shows cardiomegaly, and, we got the echocardiogram as well. And that showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a, rejection ejection fraction of the left ventricle about 60%. EKG confirmed this. He had a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. He had a left ax left ventricle hypertrophy voltage, criteria, and he had tall r wave and the septal leads. Otherwise, this patient, was referred, to cardiology and to the cardiothoracic surgeon for a potential septal myectomy, or alcohol injection as well as an AICD, placement. I started the patient on disopyramide and admitted him to nursing for for vitals every 2 hours. Activity is tolerated and strict and strict ins and outs. He's gonna get a daily weight. DVT prophylaxis and nasal cannula to keep his oxygen above 96%. Diet wise, we'll keep him on a regular diet, and, we'll keep him in the in telemetry unit until monitoring is over. Patient has NYHA class 2 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and, he's ready to be seen. Thank you. Bye bye."
"Just met with a patient who I wanted to present to you about. Mister Palmer, a 62 year old man, came into the ED complaining with shortness of breath and fatigue. He reported that he feels tired during exercise, but denies any pain. His vitals showed heart rate of 110, oxygen side of 96%, pulse of 110, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, and blood pressure of 1 30 over 90. So this shows that he his heart rate is a bit elevated. Oxygen is normal. Pulse is a little elevated. Respiratory is normal. No present fever and a slightly high blood pressure. As for medical history, he denies any past surgeries, but has had a cardiac catheter examination in a previous hospitalization. He reports a medical history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams, one tap per day. He is up to date on his immunizations. He has no known drug allergies. Reported that his father died of a heart attack many decades ago, and his mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40. Mister Palmer states that he maintains a balanced diet and exercise routine and denies any illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, or tobacco use. He does have normal caffeine intake as he is a elementary school teacher, and he is in a in a monogamous relationship with his wife with whom he will be supported by today, and they do have insurance. In review of systems, mister Palmer reported that he has general fatigue with no pain. He doesn't recall any rash or escalations. He denies any neuro discomfort and denies getting dizzy or losing consciousness. He denies any heat issues, but does report feeling a flutter in his chest and feeling dismay. As for pulmonary, he reports wheezing upon dyspnea. For MSK, he denies any joint aches or pains and doesn't report any edema. Afterwards, I conducted a physical exam, and JBD was negative. No prodded bruise were heard. Cardio exam was positive for regular systolic murmur with PMI displaced laterally. There was negative chest wall tenderness. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there was no peripheral edema, and pulses were normal. The calf was not tender. After physical examination and examining past medical history, I came to the diagnosis that mister Palmer had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HOCOM. The lab bios were normal. The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. The echo showed left ventricular asymmetric ejection fraction of 60%. The EKG was normal sinus rhythm with tall r wave septal leads and left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient was counseled and told his medications would change. I suggested taking him off the Lisinopril and administering disopyramide. His performer was told that he would be admitted into the hospital telemetry to monitor his cardiac function, and he'd be given a consult with interventional cardiology for possible AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgeon for possible myomectomy or alcohol injection. Thank you."
"Robin Service, and I saw a patient named Leslie Palmer, which came in today for a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. Mister Palmer is a 62 year old male that comes in complaining of these symptoms beginning about 6 months ago, progressively getting worse, especially within the last 3 days. He does not have any chest pain. However, at this point too, he must sleep in a recliner because he cannot, he cannot get down or lay down without having shortness of breath symptoms. Overall, this limits his life to about 10 out of 10. Past surgical history includes triple bypass surgery and 5 stents being placed. Overall, both surgeries were successful. He does have a support system at home in which he is married to his wife of 30 years. He works as a, elementary school teacher. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Overall, he has a good diet. In terms of exercise, he used to go on walks and no longer can due to the symptomology presence. The medications he's on is atorvastatin 10 milligrams, Lisinopril 10 milligrams, clopidogrel 75, metformin, 500, bi daily, grosamine, 20, bi daily, warfarin, 2.5, bi daily, and then metoprolol succinate, 50. In terms of review of systems, he said that he did have weight gain of about £8 within the last couple of weeks, does complain of fatigue, has lower extremity edema, does have wheezing present, dysphemia, orthopnea, no heart palpitations, though, and no chest pain associated. The patient overall seems like he's awake, alert oriented, but fatigued again. In terms of vital signs, his temp was 98.6, heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22, blood pressure, he was a bit hypertensive at 80 over 50, and his SpO2 was 86%. Upon physical exam findings, there were no carotid bruise, however, JVD was present. The patient was tachycardic. A murmur that was an SQ split was heard upon physical exam. PMI was displaced laterally too by, there were bibasilaribrolleys associated in the lungs Based on labs that were found, the troponin was high at 0.04 and the BNP was about 4,000, indicating that there was pulmonary edema associated and that the heart tissue was breaking down. Left ventricular end diastolic, volume was less than 30%. And also upon EKG rating, this patient did have a left bundle branch block. Overall, the patient did have a NYHA of a class 4 because anytime that he got up from a resting position, he ended up having some ophthalmology. Overall, the plan for this patient is to admit them to the ICU, get vitals every 2 hours, start being only in bed rest for nursing interventions, daily in and out should be taken, daily weights as well, DVT prophylaxis. They should be on a strict low NA plus, diet that also corresponds with their diabetes diet as well. They need to keep their vein open, so KBO. In terms of medications, which of all the ones that they were on, they need to stop them, except for the clopidogrel 75 milligrams and warfarin 2.5, 2 times daily because we do not want to throw a clot. We are also going to add dobutamine IV drip and an insulin sliding scale due to diabetes. Dobutamine will be used to allow for better contraction of the heart since there was that pulmonary edema. See. So in terms of labs that need to be found or keep taken, we need to get serial troponins taking taken, to see if that heart tissue is breaking down more. And also we need to get an INR because of a warfarin. And a consult for cardiologist was discussed with the patient, and this hopefully will be able to help them either be on a CRTD or an AICD placement. Thank you so much. Bye bye."
"62 year old patient Leslie presents to the emergency room for dyspnea and fatigue. Patient states that his symptoms began 2 weeks ago, and he went to his primary care 3 days ago and was informed to go to the emergency room. He noticed that his symptoms have worsened today. He states that his shortness of breath occurs when he is exercising but not at rest, and his NYHA functional classification was a level 2. He has not taken anything for his symptoms. Positive ROS symptoms included palpitations, pre syncope, fatigue, wheezing, and dyspnea. All other ROS symptoms were negative. Patient has a past medical history of hypertension and is currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for it. He describes his diet as balanced and states he used to exercise daily with walking, until his symptoms started and he's no longer, because of the shortness of breath. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He's an elementary school teacher, and he's married and currently lives with his wife. He notes he has had a previous catheterization completed, which was normal, but denies any other hospitalizations or surgeries. Family history included his mother dying at the age of 40 due to sudden death and his father dying at the age of 59 due to a heart attack. On the physical exam, it was noted that there was no JBD, no carotid bruise, a regular heart rate with a positive systolic murmur with an s four sound, positive for gallops, but no friction rubs. There was no chest roll tenderness, calf was nontender, lungs were cleared to auscultation bilaterally, and it was negative for lower extremity edema, and his pulses were full bilaterally in his extremities. The x-ray showed cardiomegaly and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with meeting the LVH criteria with tall r waves in the septal, waves. His vitals upon entering the room was a heart rate of a 110, his blood pressure a 130 over 90, oxygen stats of 96, respiratory rate of 16, and temperature of 98.6. Patient was admitted to telemetry and his medications upon admission were to discontinue Lisinopril and to give disopyrimide a 100 milligrams. He's given a saline lock KBO and vitals will be taken every 2 hours with strict eye and a input and output, and daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and oxygen via nasal cannula, and maintaining o two sat, over 96%. He will have a normal diet and activity as tolerated. Patient was also referred to cardiothoracic surgeon for surgical myomectomy and alcohol injection and as well as an interventional cardiologist for an AICD evaluation. Patient was diagnosed with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old woman who presented to the office today complaining of fatigue, presyncope, palpitations, and dyspnea. The patient states that her symptoms initially began approximately 3 months ago, but have worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient did see a family physician 2 weeks ago when the symptoms began to worsen, but decided to come to our office today. Since it's been 2 weeks without improvement, the patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. The patient takes Lisinopril for her hypertension, 10 milligrams by mouth daily. And she also takes prednisone. The patient's mother died suddenly at the age of 40 from unknown causes. And the patient's father passed at the age of 59 from a myocardial infarction. With respect to the patient's review of symptoms, she complained of weight gain and orthopnea. The patient states that the orthopnea has gotten to a point where she needs to sleep in a recliner at night to feel comfortable. She complains that she is unable to exercise anymore due to the discomfort. But prior to that, she did exercise frequently. It seems that lying in an upright position does help to relieve some of the patient's symptoms. Physical exam found a jugular venous distension, lung, auscultation found rails and wheezing a systolic murmur with no S4 heart sound was heard upon cardiac auscultation and lower extremity edema was also found bilaterally. The patient's chest x-ray showed a full mediastinum with a pawnbroker's sign and cardiomegaly. The patient's EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block and the patient's echo demonstrated restrictive cardiomyopathy. Based upon the patient's history and her diagnostic findings. And the patient also had an elevated BNP of 4,000 based upon the patient's history and diagnostic findings. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, most likely that had spread from her original pulmonary sarcoidosis. So she now has sarcoidosis of the heart. The patient was admitted to telemetry in serious condition. The patient is to continue taking their Lisinopril. She is to increase the dose of her prednisone, and she is also to start furosemide. The patient is going to consult with an interventional cardiologist for the potential placement of an a I C D. And the patient is also going to consult with a radiologist for a pet scan. The patient has insurance and the patient is married with a spouse willing to help her during this time. The patient was in compliance and she had no further questions."
"Shortness of breath and fatigue, which was progressively getting worse over the past 6 months. Now he experiences these symptoms at rest when at the beginning he was just experiencing these symptoms during exercise and strenuous activity. Now his past medical history includes hypertension, hypoglycemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation. He has a past surgical history of 3 coronary artery bypass grafts and 5 drug eluting stents. His pertinent review of systems included a 8 pound weight gain in the past few weeks as well as being positive for orthopnea and wheezing. And he showed, one plus ingedema in his lower extremities. For his active medical problems, we found that there was hypertension and hypoxia at 80 over 50 for the blood pressure in an s p 2 SPO 2 of 86 on room air. The manner of his vitals were within normal limits. For his allergies and medications as well as substance use, he was shown to smoke 1 pack per day for the past 25 years at least. His meds include metoprolol succinate, 15 milligrams once a day. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day. Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day. Metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day. Furosemide, 20 milligrams, twice a day. Plopidogrel, 75 milligrams, once a day. Warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, twice a day. For his social history, this revealed no abnormal, behaviors other than the cigarette smoking, for 1 pack per day over the last 25 years. Relevant PE findings. S split s 2 was noticed on the cardiac auscultation as well as a laterally displaced PMI. Lung sounds in indicated pulmonary edema, and 1 plus pinning edema of the legs was examined when, the calves were examined for swell. For his diagnostic, labs and procedures, the X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with, pulmonary edema. The echo showed a dilated left ventricle, and the EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. His labs were positive for an elevated component at 0.04 and an elevated BNP at 4,000. His likely diagnosis was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy for which he will be treated in the following way. He'll be admitted to the ICU, with a diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, with an NYHA score of 4. His condition is considered serious. Allergies no known drug allergies, as previously stated. His vitals will be checked at least every 2 hours. He will be confined to bed rest, during his stay, And nursing interventions will be including a strict input output, daily weights. So they're gonna be taking his weight on daily and, DVT prophylaxis. His diet will be low sodium. His IV fluids will only have will only be put at keep it open to make sure that the IV, remains in place. And the medications that he normally takes will be held aside from clopidogrel and warfarin, and dobutamine will be added to, ensure his blood pressure is corrected. For means of respiratory therapy, he will be put on BiPAP at 16 over 6 with an FiO2 of 50%. For repeat diagnostic labs in in procedures, what will be completed is only a serial component to see if that corrects with treatment. Interventional cardiology will be consulted, for possible AICD placement and possible, CRKD, placement as well. And, he would be the patient would be advised of maintaining a healthy weight, weight reduction, keeping away from strenuous physical activity, and he will also be advised to, stop smoking cigarettes if possible. Alright."
"I just got finished seeing patient Leslie Palmer. She prefers to go by miss Palmer. She came up with a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. It started about 2 months ago. She's also having syncope, palpitations, dyspnea, orthopnea, and she also had an 8 pound weight gain, in her legs, mainly from the edema that she's experiencing. It's worse with physical activity. So she's an NYHA class 3, but better with rest. She is sleeping in her recliner due to the fact that she, is having orthopnea and not being able to breathe while she's laying down. She did have a cardiac catheterization 25 years ago, but they didn't find anything. Her father died when he was 59 years old from myocardial infarction and her mom at 40, from sudden death, without known cause. She has not been hospitalized other than the calf. In terms of her medical condition, she has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. But she has no known drug allergies. In terms of her diet, she eats a balanced diet. She exercises daily, except she hasn't been able to for at least the past 2 months because of all of her current symptoms. She also does not use drugs, no tobacco, no alcohol, but does drink a cup of coffee daily. She's an elementary school teacher who's been married for 30 years and has a good support system with her spouse who she lives with. In terms of her vital signs, her temperature looked good. Her heart rate was elevated at 110. Respirations were 22. Her, blood pressure was a 136 over 99, and her oxygen, sats were 91%. So with that, I went ahead and admitted her, into telemetry and diagnosed her with sarcoidosis restrictive, cardiomyopathy. It a serious condition, where the I, order for the nurses to check every 2 hours, and, she can only come out of bed with assistance. In terms of instructions, strict I INOs, daily weights, nasal cannula, and also maintaining 96%, and also DVT prophylaxis, with a low sodium diet, KVO. In terms in terms of her medications, I'm continuing Lisinopril because her blood pressure is still elevated. In terms of her prednisone, I am increasing the dose to 60 milligrams since it's an acute exasperation. I also added on IV furosemide to help get rid of some of the edema. And, also, I added on, amiodarone since I noticed that she was having a non sustained ventricular tachycardia on her EKG. In terms of lab work, I went ahead and ordered a CMP, just since I, put her on furosemide. And I've gone ahead and made consultations with an intermutual cardiologist to come and look about AICD placement as well as a, radiologist and nuclear radiologist for the FDG PET scan. Thank you."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting with worsening shortness of breath. She had a cold 2 weeks ago that has improved, but since then she has continued to have non radiating dull retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath. Her her activities have become limited due to her dyspnea, and she has gained £8 in the past 2 weeks. She has been sleeping in a recliner due to orthopnea. She has shortness of breath with any activity, including walking across a room, but her symptoms improve at rest. She has not had any fever for the past 5 days. Past medical history includes hypertension that she takes Lisinopril for, and she had a cardiac cath completed 1 year ago that was normal. She was evaluated by her PCP recently where she had a chest x chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. She also had an echo that showed dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF at less than 30%, and an EKG that showed some sinus tachycardia with 2 beats of PBCs in the left bundle branch. Lab work was, lab work, had elevated troponin of 0.1 and elevated BNP of 4,000. On vitals, she had sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 and a pulse ox of 91. She had a slightly elevated blood pressure of 130 over 90. On physical, I noted a JVD, whale, wheezes, rails, and pinning edema. For diagnosis, I think she has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to her illness that she had 2 weeks ago. For the plan, currently to admit to telemetry, I'm gonna start her on o two nasal cannula for her low pulse ox. We're also gonna order her lab work, serial troponin and CMP. I'd like to get a repeat to the echo as well. For her medications, I'll have her continue on her lisinopril, order furosemide 40 IV for her edema, and also acetaminophen 625 for her pain. Referrals are gonna refer her to interventional cardiology for evaluation of AICD, CRTD, and potential and ventricular right ventricular biopsy. We're also considered to an infectious disease for IVIG or glucocorticoids, and finally, radiology or an MRI of her chest with contrast."
"Your case presentation on a new patient. Miss Palmers is a 62 year old female presenting with the chief complaint of orthopnea and fatigue that started 2 months ago but has gotten worse the past 3 days. She has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams and prazedone 10 milligrams for. She has no allergies. She has gained £8 in the past 2 weeks, has dyspnea, palpitations, and sometimes has feelings of presyncory. She also mentioned swelling in her ankle. She had a cardiac catheter put in 1 year ago. Regarding her social history, she has a balanced diet, no alcohol, illicit drug, or tobacco use. She drinks 1 cup of coffee a day. She is currently sexually active and lives with her husband. She is generally active and walks with her friends regularly, but she has not been able to do that recently. Currently, she is NYHA, class 3 with marked limitations of physical activity. Regarding her family, her mother is deceased and passed away from sudden death, and her father died at 59 due to myocardial infarction. Now in regards to your vitals, temperature was 98.6. Heart rate was 110. Respiratory rate was 20. Pulse was 108. Blood pressure was 136 over 99, and oxygen level was 91%. Cardiopulmonary physical exam showed positive GVD, no cardi carotid bruit, regular heart rate murmur, presence of gallop presence of murmur, rails, and wheezing. She had pital edema and DPPT pulses were full slash equal. Her pulses were elevate her labs showed elevated BNP at 4,000. X-ray showed normal heart size, pulmonary edema, and mediastinal fullness. ECHO showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness with an ejection fraction at 55%, and EKG showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Homan's side testing for DVT was negative. So at this point, sarcoidosis restricted cardiomyopathy, was suspected. So I spoke to her about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about her social support and insurance. At this time, she'll be admitted to telemetry. Letters will be taken every 2 hours and activity instructions or out of bed with assistance. Nursing intervention with strict I slash o, daily weight, o two, 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula, DVT prophylaxis, and maintaining her oxygen saturation about 96%. Diet is low, sodium, and KBO for fluid IVs. Medication will include prazedone 60 milligrams PO. She will continue taking her Lisinopril 10 milligrams PO, and we will add furosemide 40 mg via IV every 12 hours. CMP was ordered. Should be consulted by interventional cardiologist and a radiologist for possible AICV placement and for FDG PET scan. Thank you so much."
"The ER today can plenty of, fatigue and shortness of breath for the last week or so. She knows that the, fatigue and shortness of breath is much worse upon any type of exertion or just regular moving around. It's also she also notes some orthopnea that is improved when she sits up, and, she actually prefers to sit in her recliner. She pay, patient notes that approximately two and a half weeks ago, she had a cold, runny nose, fever, and some shortness of breath with a cough, and, also some fatigue. Patient has no no significant history other than hypertension. Her search social or surgical procedural history, she had a cardiac cath last year. Family history, her mom died of breast cancer. Dad is living with Alzheimer's. Social, she eats a balanced diet. She exercises 2 times a week, but ever since, these symptoms began, she has not been able to exercise without significant shortness of breath. She does not use drugs, tobacco, alcohol. She does drink a cup of coffee a day every day, and, she lives with her husband right now. Medications, she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams for for the hypertension, and she has no known allergies. Her biosynthetic symptoms besides the fatigue, she denied today any fever, chills, weight loss, or weight gain. She had no rashes, skin discoloration, lesions, or, bruising. Musculoskeletal, patient noted some leg swelling, but denied any muscle aches, joint pain, back pain. Cardiovascular, she did have she noted some chest pain and some palpitations, but denies any syncopal episodes. She, pulmonary, she did have some orthopnea and some and she noted some wheezing and the, obviously, she had the disc the dyspnea. Neuro patient had no complaints. She denied, gait disturbances, dizziness, or confusion, HNT. She denied any neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, vision changes, hearing loss. And then upon presentation today, her vital sign, her blood pressure was 130 over 90, temperature 98.6. She was tachycardiac at 110, and her o two sat was 91. Upon physical exam, she had regular, regular vein distension, cardiovascularly regular, no murmurs, no friction rub, no gallops. She did have a displaced PMI laterally. Lungs on to auscultation, I noted by vascular rails and wheezing, MSK 1 plus pitting edema bilaterally in both, lower extremities. Neuro neurological exam was normal. So today, we ordered troponin, BNP, EKG, chest x-ray echo. Troponin was point 1, which is mildly elevated. BNP was elevated at 4,000. EKG, she she was sinus tachycardic at 100. Right there was a right bundle branch block, RSR in in the right leads. She had left axis deviation and premature ventricular contractions in AVR, AVLAVF. On chest x-ray, there there was palm pulmonary edema and, cardiomegaly. Echo showed, a dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction, less than 30%. So I discussed I discussed this lab work and the, imaging with the patient. I diagnosed her with, a myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and I discussed that it's probably related to the the viral illness she had a few weeks ago. So we we're going to admit her to telemetry. She's gonna see, interventional radiology for AICD placement and CRT. They might even wanna do an endomyocardial biopsy. We'll also consult with, infectious disease for, immunoglobulin glucocorticoids as well as, radiology for contrast MRI. So we're gonna keep her on Lisinopril, add acetaminophen for the pain, and we're gonna get her on a furosemide 40 milligrams IV to get that fluid off. And then I just I discussed all the findings. I discussed the plan with the patient. We discussed the cause of the, myocarditis, and, I discussed the treatment options for her and told her that she's gonna be in great hands."
"Palmer. Mister Palmer walked into the ED today with a chief complaint of chest palpitations and difficulties when exercising. Mister Palmer is currently being treated for hypertension with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and his symptoms were onset during, a bout of exercise. And mister Palmer states that he has no trouble when lying down. No trouble breathing when lying down. Some background history on mister Palmer is that he, tries to walk every day until his symptoms, and he has a balanced diet. He drinks 1 cup of coffee a day, and some paths of relevant past family medical history include a myocardial infarction on his father's side and a sudden death, from his mother who died at a premature age of 40. And mister Palmer had mentioned that he had initially gone to his PCP to get some work done and that his PCP told him to come to the ED to have his symptoms further evaluated. He has been hospitalized in the past for a cath procedure, which came back, okay as he stated, and as he also had an EKG at that time. And mister Palmer presented tired, fatigued, and weak, but he had no chest pain, only the palpitations. And he said that he almost had felt like as if he was gonna faint sometimes, leading me to think of presyncope. And in addition to, that during the review of systems, relevant findings on the pulmonary side included dyspnea. And during the physical, exam, there is no fetal edema noted or pitting, and his PMI was displaced laterally. And during counseling, I went over all of his labs, and his labs included an x-ray showing cardiomegaly and a a two d echo showing septal growth in the myocardium of the heart and an EKG indicate indicating, familial cardio familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, due to the growth in the septal the septal waves. And for treatment, I counseled mister Palmer on discontinuing his lisinopril, and I, think it's best to plan and and administer a dosage of disopyramide for him to help with his palpitations. And I would like to admit mister Palmer to telemetry for monitoring and, ultimately, have him consulted by interventional cardiology in order to get an AICD placed and cardiothoracic surgery, to consult him on a potential septal myectomy and alcohol alcohol injection. And that essentially concludes my notes on this patient encounter today and relevant vitals encounter included an elevated heart rate and an elevated blood pressure as well. And that concludes my patient"
"Miss Palmer, a 62 year old woman, came into the office. She was complaining of, fatigue and shortness of breath. She is awake and alert and just seems fatigued. She says that she had a cold about 2 weeks ago, during which she experienced some chills, fever, coughing, and wheezing. She can't tolerate any physical activity, but, however, the symptoms are better whenever she sleeps in her recliner. However, the symptoms are better when she sleeps in the recliner. Okay. Past medical history, she has hypertension. She takes the 10 milligrams of flasinopril for that. She's had no surgeries in the past. Her mother passed away of breast cancer at the age of 80, and her dad has Alzheimer's. Socially, she eats a well balanced diet. Aside from the fatigue that she's starting to feel recently, she exercises twice a week, and she does not smoke any tobacco. She does not do any illicit drugs. She does not drink alcohol. She does drink caffeine. She's an elementary school teacher, and she lives with her husband. For her review of systems, 2 weeks ago, she complained that she had, she admitted to having fever. She does not have any chills. She said that she had gained weight, and she feels fatigue. Her skin assessments were negative. Her skin assessments were negative, but she complains of chest pains and palpitation and has no, syncope. She also complains of reason and coughing and having to sleep in her chair. Her near exam was impressive, But she complains of myalgia. Okay, her vital signs for her vital signs She had a heart rate of 110 a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and, o two of 91 in room air, pulse of, 110, and a respiration of 20. After asking her, after us asking her about her post medical history and assessing her vital signs with her, I went ahead and put up the physical exam. The physical exam showed the suspended internal jugular. She had jugular vein distension. She had bibacilla rails, an auscultation of her lungs. She also had pulmonary edema. There were no palpitations or irregular heartbeats, upon auscultation of the heart. And her pulse were also present. Her dorsal is his pulse is present, and they were strong. After the physical exam, we went ahead and reviewed her imaging on her x-ray. Her x-ray showed cardiomegaly. It also showed a fusion of the lungs, pummonary edema. Her echo showed the enlarged left ventricle with a reduced ejection fracture. The EKG EKG showed, left axis, tachycardia, premature ventricle contractions. It also showed a right bundle branch block. So for her diagnosis, I went ahead and diagnosed her with myocarditis, dilated myocarditis. I told her that the condition was serious and that we're gonna admit her to telemetry. We are going to continue her on Lisinopril, put her on, fluorescently, and then, acetaminophen for her chest pain. She we're gonna consult cardiology, interventional cardiology. We're also gonna come to, contact infectious diseases and then, radiology as well. I ordered an ICD and a group of court corticoids together with that as well. I asked if she had insurance. She confirmed the family insurance, and she had family support that was gonna help her through this time. And so that's my case present my case present here on miss Palmer. Thank you, doc."
"So the patient, miss Leslie Palmer, is a female patient who's 62 with chief complaint of dyspnea and fatigue. The patient mentioned that it has been going for on for 2 weeks with cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, and chest pain. She also mentioned arthopnea. 5 days ago, the cough went away while the shortness of breath and fatigue have remained. She mentioned a past fever. The patient has no surgical history or hospitalization or allergies. She mentioned hypertension. It's taking Lisinopril, a 10 milligram orally for that. She mentioned a balanced diet with exercise diet with exercise 2 times a week. However, due to her symptoms, she couldn't she isn't able to exercise, currently. She mentions no drug, alcohol, or tobacco use, and she mentions drinking coffee about a cup a day. Is an elementary school teacher and sexually active with her husband. Patient's up to date with immunization, and she reports, other symptoms such as arrhythmia, wheezing, swelling, and says she's sleeping on a recliner indicating orthopnea. So physical exam was performed. So lung and heart auscultations were performed and OMM was performed as well, with the focus of chart changes, final examination, and, tissue tenderness. Home and test was also performed. There was a jugular venous distension. No buries, regular heart rate, no chest wall tenderness. There were rails and wheezing, present during physical exam, and there was pitting edema as well. The heart rate was a 110. Oxygen was 91. Blood pressure was 130 over 90, and respiratory rate was 20. The chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomically, and the echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. The troponin, the lab showed troponin was high at 0.1 and BNP was high at 4,000. And, on EKG, it showed a right bundle branch block, with sinus tag and left axis deviation. All the labs and images were explained individually to the patient. The diagnosis made was myocarditis with, dilated cardiomyopathy, and this explains the patient. For orders, patient will be admitted to telemetry for serious condition, and vitals will be taken every 2 hours. Strict IO daily weight and DVT prophylaxis with o two nasal cannula and o two stat greater than 96% will be recommended. A low sodium diet would be recommended. Also, Lisinopril will be, continued at 10 milligram. Acetaminophen will be added at 625 milligram orally, and furosemide IV at 40 milligram will also be added. A repeat of echo will be ordered as well as a repeat of troponin and CNP. There will be referral to interventional cardiology for AID and CRTD and infectious disease for immunoglobulin and also, radiology for a media enhanced MRI. And all these were explained, the diagnosis, imaging, and next steps were explained to the patient. And that concludes my case presentation. Thank you."
"Mister Leslie Palmer's case. Mister Leslie Palmer was a patient in room 11 at our emergency room today. Mister Palmer presented to the emergency department with as a 62 year old male who came to the ED due to feeling short of breath for the last 6 months. Mister Palmer stated that he felt sore all over and couldn't participate in any exercise without feeling short of breath or feeling tired in general. Mister Palmer also stated that he had a lower extremity edema bilaterally as well as only feels comfort at rest in the semifoular position. Mister Palmer, his past medical history consists of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His past surgical history includes a stent placed 5 years ago and a CABG coronary artery bypass graft placed 12 years prior to the visit today. Mister Palmer has no known allergies and takes numerous medications such as atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. Mister Palmer lives at home. He's married. He currently lives with his wife. On upon physical exam, mister Palmer displayed JVD, laterally replaced PMI, laterally displaced PMI, rails, pedal edema, as well as cardiomegal megalite, and pulmonary edema on chest x-ray X-ray. Mister Palmer's EKG consists of normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. Mister Palmer also had, a left bundle branch block as well as met left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. He also his lab work displayed elevated troponin as well as BNP. With this said, mister Palmer was diagnosed with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. His echo also showed this and supported this with the dilated ventricle as well as thinned septum. He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and evaluation by interventional cardiology. Mister Palmer's diagnosis warranted vitals every 2 hours, a strict bed rest, nursing interventions, as well as a low sodium diet, KBO, clitogrel, warfarin, and dobutamine administration, as well as an insulin sliding scale. This concludes mister Palmer's case presentation. Thank you."
"Alright. Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old woman who presents to the ER today complaining of dyspepnea ongoing for 6 month 6 months and worsening the last 3 days. She has orthopnea, dyspepnea, and is a new is an NYHA class 4. She's a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease. Her current meds are atorvastatin, clopidrogyal, furosemide, metoprolol, succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. She has no drug allergies. She has a surgical history of multiple cardiac stents, coronary artery bypass graft. She her vital signs were heart rate of 90, blood pressure 80 over 50, her SPO 2 is 86, and her temperature was 98. She has a maternal family history of breast cancer and a paternal family history of Alzheimer's. Her physical exam reveals rails, wheezing, plus 1 pedigedema, splitting of the s 2, laterally to play laterally displaced PMI, splitting s 2, jugular venous distension, no cap tenderness, and equal pulses. Her chest X-ray reveals, cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Her EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. She has left ventricular hypertrophic criteria on her EKG. Her duty here are 2 d echo, reveals dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30. She has elevated troponin and elevated BNP. I diagnosed her with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and I measured her to the ICU and placed her on a BiPAP. I ordered an IV to keep the veins open. I continued her on clopidrogel and warfarin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. I kept her on furosemide. However, I should have placed her on dobutamine. She's on strict bed rest. I ordered full of labs of the PT slash PTTINR and serial troponins. I consulted an interventional cardiologist for AICD and CRT slash d placement."
"Right. Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old male with past medical history of hypertension who presents at the referral of his primary care provider for approximately 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion with accompanying fatigue and wheezing. He states that his symptoms only present with exercise and are relieved by rest. He explicitly states that his shortness of breath improves with lying down. Leslie also mentions a pre syncopal sensation with exercise and heart palpitations. He denies experiencing a syncopal episode, only feeling like he may pass out. He describes his palpitations as a fluttering and speeding up of his heart. He denies any chest pain, any lower extremity edema, or any recent changes in his weight. He says he's compliant with his Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He notes a cardiac cath approximately 1 year ago, which was normal. He says his father died of a heart attack at the age of 59, and his mother died suddenly at the age of 40. He has no known drug allergies, and he denies tobacco and alcohol use. He also denies illicit drug use. He says he drinks about 1 cup of coffee a day and has a balanced diet with minimal salt intake, or addition of salt, I should say. He is employed as a teacher, and lives at home with his wife. He says before his symptoms, begin, he was walking a few days per week, but is unable to exercise with his symptoms now. On physical exam, he does have a systolic murmur with an s four in gallop. He has no chest wall tenderness, no JVD, no carotid bruise, no, abdominal bruise. His PMI is laterally displaced. He has, lungs are cleared to auscultation bilaterally. His calves are non tender, no pedal edema, negative Hohmann's sign. He has strong and equal DP and PT pulses. Chest stroke spray was significant for cardiomegaly, but otherwise normal. His echo showed, interventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed, left ventricular hypertrophy and tall r waves in the septal leads. Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits. I told him that he most likely has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and then we'd like to admit him to the hospital. I said he'd be started on diazepiramate for arrhythmia control, and that we'd also like to consult interventional cardiology for possible placement of an AICD. And we'd also talk to cardiothoracic surgery about a possible septomyomectomy or alcohol injection. He seemed to understand the plan. He noted he does have insurance to help cover the cost of of his hospital stay. Yes. That's it."
"A 62 year old female patient presents ED with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. Patient reports gradual worsening and shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling like passing out over the past 2 months. She visited her primary care physician 3 weeks ago where tests were conducted, but her symptoms continued to worsen. Symptoms didn't improve with rest but worsen with physical activity. The patient mentions sleeping on a chair at night to alleviate the symptoms. Patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. She currently takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams. She does not have any known allergies, and she does not use any substances such as tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs. She does consume 1 cup of coffee per day. The patient reports a balanced diet, exercised regularly, but much less since her since some start up. She works as an elementary school teacher, is in a monogamous relationship, and has insurance and also support at home. On physical examination, the patient appeared well developed, well nourished, fatigued, awake, and orient. Notable findings include elevated jugular vein distension, a systolic murmur, RAILs, and one plus pitting edema of the lower extremities. BNP was elevated at 404,000. CA, chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and mediasnoidfulness. ECHO showed restricted cardiomyopathy with a 50% 55% ejection fraction. The EKG was suggested of a nonsustained V tach with normal sinus rhythm. And overall, the sixtieteorial male, female, with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension presenting worsening, shortness of breath, palpitations, near fainting episodes, demonstrating signs of volume overload and restrictive cardiomyopathy. So for her plan, we decided to admit her for telemetry with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis or street of cardiomyopathy and, 3 on the NYHA scale. Considering the seriousness of her condition, there was no known drug allergies to be noted, and vitals were to be closely monitored at 2 hours. The patient will be encouraged to engage in mobility with assistance. Nursing instructions are strict intake, outtake monitoring, daily weight measurements, DVT prophylaxis, and the use of oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation over 96%. The patient will be placed on a low sodium diet to manage fluid retention. IV fluids will be administered via saline lock to keep the open rate at a keep the open rate. Medications will be continued as previously prescribed, including Lisinopril 10 milligrams QD. And additional, medication will be initiated such as amiodarone 150 milligrams IV and an increase in prednisone to 16 milligrams QD. And furosemide IV, 40 milligrams. A comprehensive metabolic manner will be ordered. Overall organ function, Consultation with, interventional cardiology will be made for consideration of an AICD placement and a consultation with nuclear medicine radiology will be arranged for a FGE PET scan. To further evaluate the sarcoid. The patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet, work towards weight reduction, and avoid strenuous physical activity until released by the physician. Cut."
"So missus Palmer is a 62 year old female with a past medical history of hypertension on 10 milligrams of Lisinopril daily, and she's presenting to the emergency department today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. She states that 2 weeks ago, she had a cough, a fever, and a runny nose along with her current symptoms, and she says that those all subsided about 5 days ago, but the ones that are currently presenting are still persisting through. Her chest pain is described as being subexternal, constant, and dull, and it doesn't radiate anywhere else. Nothing seems to specifically aggravate it, but she has also not tried any medications, but she does note that reclining back, makes her symptoms a little better. Her current pain level is a 2 out of 10, and she feels that her chest pain is at rest, which would classify her as an NYHA of 4. Her only surgical history is a cardiac catheterization about a year ago, that showed no obstructive coronary artery disease, and she has no known drug allergy. She doesn't smoke, drink, or do any illicit substances at all. She works as an elementary school teacher, and her family history is positive for a mom who passed away from breast cancer at the age of 80, and her current father is, 80 89, and he's in the nursing home for Alzheimer's right now. She states she eats a well balanced diet, and she was exercising 2 times a week for about an hour at a time, but she hasn't been able to given her current symptoms. She drinks a cup of coffee a day, and she's currently married and lives in a stable household with her husband of 30 years, and she's still sexually active with just her husband and only her husband. Her vitals at the consultation were a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. Her respiratory rate was a 20, and her temperature was at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. On the review of systems, she was positive for fatigue and recent weight gains of 8 weight gain of £8. She noted palpitations and chest pain with no syncope. Her she also noted wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, and some lower extremity edema. Her physical exam, showed jugular vein distension with no carotid bruise. Her heart rate was regular with no murmur, friction rubs, or any gallops. On palpitation of her PMI, it was noted to be laterally displaced, and her lungs were positive for bibasilar rails and wheezing. She also had one plus hitting edema in her lower extremity, but her, she also had a negative home and sign and, pulses were full and equal bilaterally as well. On the imaging that was done upon entering the ER today, her chest x-ray showed that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Her echo was interpreted by the radiologists and was found to have a dilated left ventricle, an ejection fraction of 30%. Her EKG showed that she had sinus tachycardia with about a 100 beats per minute on that and a right bundle branch block, and there were also, a few captured preventricular contractions as well. Her lab showed a triponin of 0.1 and a BNP of 4,000, And given all her history, physical exam, and diagnostic exams that were done, a diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy was made. The treatment plan for missus Palmer was to admit her to telemetry, take vitals every 2 hours, and have nursing the nurses monitor her ins and outs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and, bring her oxygen up with an o two nasal cannula trying to get her sats over 96%. We should keep her on a diet low in sodium and have her restricted on oral fluid intake. She will also be on an IV fluid saline lock KVO. She was instructed to continue taking her Lisinopril while in the hospital and thereafter, and we'll also add on some acetaminophen 625, every 6 hours by mouth and furosemide 40 milligrams IV and also a beta blocker metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams by mouth while she's in the hospital. Additionally, we're gonna get repeat labs with superior serial troponins and a 2 d echo, during her stay here. We also consulted interventional cardiology for a CRTD and potential AICD placement, and also a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted as well just for potential immunoglobulin and glucocorticoid treatment if they deem it necessary. And then lastly, the radiologist was consulted for a potential media enhanced MRI if they also deem that necessary. Overall, missus Palmer expressed no concerns with being admitted to the hospital or to the treatment plan moving forward."
"Today, I'm presenting patient miss Palmer, who is a pleasant but somewhat fatigued appearing 62 year old female patient with a chief complaint of fatigue, shortness of breath, and dull chest pain, which began about 2 weeks ago. She says she just had some fever, cough, and runny nose when her symptoms began and believed that she just had a cold. She continued to exercise, believing she just had the common cold, but noticed she was unable to complete her exercises due to shortness of breath and fatigue, which was unusual for her. Miss Palmer states her symptoms have been constant since her onset, and nothing has made it better, but notices that exercise can make it worse. She has tried nothing medically for her symptoms and rates their severity as a 2 out of 10 today. Regarding her medical history, she did have a cardiac cat about a year ago and does have a history of hypertension. She has no allergies. She exercised about 2 to 3 times a week before symptoms began and was unable to do so since. She does not use any drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. She does drink about 1 cup of coffee per day. She currently does work as an elementary school teacher and lives comfortably at home with her husband. She has no prior history of hospitalizations. She mentions no family history when inquired. She is currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams periorally daily for her hypertension. Her general review of systems revealed no fever or chills today, although they did occur 2 weeks ago when her symptoms began. She does have fatigue today as well as an 8 pound weight gain. Her skin ROS is negative. Her head, eye, ears, nose, and throat ROS is also negative. Her cardio ROS reveals some dull chest pain today accompanied by palpitations, but no presyncope. Culinary pulmonary ROS does have shortness of breath, wheezing and has been sleeping on a recliner due to her orthopnea. Her MSK ROS, reveals some mild muscle aches in her lower legs as well as noticeable swelling in her lower extremities. Her neuro ROS is negative. She is otherwise well developed and well nourished, albeit with some fatigue and is alert and oriented today. She's not in any pain when asked. A thorough physical examination was performed, and notably, there was some JVD in her neck area. She also did have some bilateral rails and wheezing on auscultation of the lungs. However, we regarding a cardiac examination, she revealed no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, but did have a laterally displaced PMI. Her lower extremity did reveal 1 plus pitting edema. However, their the caps were symmetric and negative homininsine alluded no concern for DVT at this time. Her abdomen was also soft and nontender, and there were no tart changes noted. Her vitals were normal except for a mild tachycardia of 110 and her respiratory rate of 20, a blood pressure of 1 30 over 90, and o two sat of 91 today. Her labs, including chest x-ray, which reveals some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, her EKG, which reveals some right bundle branch block in sinus tachycardia, and her 2 d echo, which revealed 30% ejection fraction and dilated cardiomyopathy. Her blood work revealed troponin slightly elevated and BNP of 4,000 and slightly elevated. This will review with the patient and a primary diagnose of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class 2, was made given her presentation. We plan to admit her to med with telemetry. Her condition is currently serious. Vitals are to be taken every 2 hours, and her activity levels can be managed as tolerated. Nursing was instructed to manage strict input output, daily weight changes, DVT prophylaxis, as well as o two via nasal cannula, and her o two saturation is to be maintained above 96%. She is also recommended to have a low sodium diet, and perioral fluid restriction is recommended at this time. IV flus are to be locked, and the veins are to be kept open. She has no allergies. Acetaminophen 6 25 milligrams periorally every 6 hours is recommended to help with her inflammation, and she is to continue Lisinopril as previously prescribed with 10 milligrams every day. We are to add furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 12 hours to help reduce the swelling. We will repeat 0 troponin and get a CMP as she now she is now on furosemide. She was referred to interventional cardiology for AICE placement as well as CRTD and a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted for referral for immune globulin as well as glucocorticoids to further reduce the swelling. Radiology consult for contrast media enhanced MRI was also recommended to detect for further myocardial inflammation. She was recommended to maintain a healthy weight and to reduce her weight, and no strange physical activity is to be recommended at this time. Patient had no further questions and was satisfied with her diagnosis and treatment plan."
"Mister Palmer is a 62 year old male in, room 2. He arrived at the emergency room, complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue, just constant fatigue. He said these symptoms gradually got worse, over the past 6 months, and, he made an appointment with his primary care physician, about 3 days ago, and, the physicians recommended him to check himself in at the emergency room. He did not complain of any chest pain. He did mention that his legs, have been swollen, likely due to, lower extremity edema. Mister Palmer also said that he gained about, £8 recently and that he's been getting, wheezes and shortness of breath, while sleeping. He has a past medical history of, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He's also had, triple bypass and a lower, ascend or sorry. Left ascending artery, stent put in, about a year ago. Mister Palmer has no pertinent family, history related to his present illness, And, he used so mister Palmer used to walk with his friends, often, but now due to his fatigue over the last 6 months, he's been unable, to walk at all. He does smoke 1 pack a day, and I have talked to him about quitting, smoking. And he has, he has interest in seeking help, and, I was gonna refer him to, a specialist who can help with that, help him help him quit. As of right now, he's currently taking, the following medications. He's taking warfarin, metformin, Lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, and metopropylol succinate. And he has no known drug allergies. His vital signs are as follows. His blood pressure is 80 over 50, which is a little hypertensive. Temperature is normal at 98.6. His SpO 2 is, 86, which is also low, and his heart rate is normal, at 90 beats per minute. Upon physical exam, mister Palmer had JVD, heart gallop, lung wheezes, and RAILs were also present. He also had pulmonary edema, in his lower extremities like he mentioned before, and he did not have any chest wall, tenderness upon palpation. After the physical exam, I told him he most likely has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and as well as a secondary diagnosis of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. For admission, we'll have to admit him to the ICU, upon serious conditions. We'll have to take his vitals every 2 hours, and he'll have be on strict bed rest with no little to no physical activity. The nurses will intervene with strict IOs, daily weights, PBT prophylaxis, as well as BiPAP. We'll put him on a low sodium diet since he has, no food allergies as well. I will order, troponin and, PTINR, for labs. We have to make sure his IV stays open and refer him to an interventional cardiologist for a, AICD. And we'll have him continue his warfarin and clopidogrel, but as well, we'll add on an insulin sliding scale and dopamine IV drip. Thanks so much."
"Mister Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old male who presents to the clinic today with, to the emergency room a chief complaint on shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, and near syncope. The patient states that he, began his symptoms about 2 weeks ago, and he went to his family medicine doctor because he was a little concerned. And his family medicine doctor ordered some tests, but he did not but the patient did not get any of his tests back. However, yesterday, the patient noticed that his, the patient noticed that his symptoms were worsening, so he decided to come to the ER. Upon presentation, the patient states that he, has trouble with some physical activity. He has some trouble with physical activity, and, he also states that he, his symptoms do get better upon rest. The patient states that he, in terms of severity, he states that while he's sitting, his severity is 0, but with any brief okay. I'm gonna start over. Alright. Alright. So I'm gonna start over. Hi, doctor Rollins. This is student doctor Akshada Sastry, and I'll be presenting the, case for mister Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male, and he, presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and near syncope. The patient states that he has had his symptoms for about 2 weeks, and, the patient reports that the patient reports that he visited his family medicine doctor about 2 weeks about few days ago, concerned about his symptoms, and the PCP decided to run some tests, but the patient has not received those back yet. The patient notes that he had, an increase in symptoms yesterday, and that's why he decided to come to the ER. The patient states that his, his symptoms began about 2 weeks ago. He states that they are better at rest, so he does not have any severity or any symptoms when he is at 0. However, he says that with some physical activity, he does have his symptoms, which made me believe that he was at a New York scale of 2. The patient states that, his symptoms do not radiate anywhere, and he did not treat with any medication because he did not know any of them. His medical history states that he's the patient mister Palmer states that he had a cardiac cath spot a year ago, and his medical for hypertension. The patient states he also did not have any allergies. In terms of his social history, the patient is, eats a very elementary school teacher. He is sexually active with his wife. Upon the ROS, patient denies all symptoms for his fatigue, shortness of breath, some wheezing, and, and some palpitations, and, of course, his presyncable episodes. And, I decided to start the physical exam at that point. I did not know any carotid bruise. I decide to listen to his, and I did not notice any chest tenderness. When I listened to his heart, I did notice an s three, s four, an s three, s four murmur as well as a gallop. I listened to his lungs, and, they were clear to bilaterally to auscultation. I decided to also check for any abdominal bruise and abdominal masses, and that was negative. He did not have any peripheral edema. He did not have any calf isometry. No Hohmann signs. And the patient, yeah. And the his his pulses were, very strong. I decided to decide I decided to get look at his vitals, and his vitals did look a little bit high. His heart rate was at a 110, and his, saturation was about 96%, which was measured okay. His respiration rate was about 16 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was a 130 over 90. Upon looking at his labs, I noticed his CMP, his troponin, and his BNP are were all normal within normal values. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%. And his EKG demonstrated tall r waves in all the septal leaves, some left ventricular hypertrophy, and, but other than that, nor normal sinus rhythm and normal access. For admission, I decided to diagnose him with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because, he did say that his family, oh, he also told me that he in terms of his family, his mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40, and his father passed away, from a myocardial infarction. So due to his history, I decided, and along with his physical exam, I decided that he has a he has his diagnosis. I decided that he would, he he needs to be, switched off his Lisinopril that he takes for his hypertension, and instead be put on, diisoparamide. And then I would like to admit him to the hospital to telemetry. I would like the nurses to be watching it for in ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis. I would like to have daily his daily weight watched, and I'd like to put him on a nasal cannula at 2 liters and keep him above 96% because of his complaint and shortness of breath. In terms of people I would like to, I the doctors I'd like to consult with him, I would like an interventional cardiologist to come see him for his AICD, and I'd also like a cardio cardiothoracic surgeon to come see him for evaluation if he needs a septal myectomy or alcohol injection. And that is the conclusion of my case presentation. Thank you."
"After a family med consult, her family doctor ordered some tests because he was concerned about her 6 month duration, dyspnea. The patient noted that the dyspnea gets better only when she lays in the recliner. She hasn't tried anything to make it better, and nothing that she tried made it, better. She rated the breathing that she would experience 9 out of 10, on the worst exertion. As far as her medical history is concerned, she had high blood pressure, high cholesterol. She was diabetic, and 5 years ago, she was diagnosed with AFib. On her father's side, he is in a nursing home currently, 89 years old. Her mother's side, she died of breast cancer. She has no allergies to medications. She had a stent put in last June. Aside from that, she had 5 stents put in total, and she had a triple bypass done. No hospitalizations. She had a list of medications that I inputted into the EMR. She has a balanced diet, exercises daily, doesn't take any drugs or alcohol, still smokes. I counsel the patient about quitting the smoking because she does one pack a day, drinks one cup of coffee a day. She's currently still an elementary school teacher, and she has a partner that was sitting in the waiting room, who she's married to for 30 years with no kids. As far as her vitals are concerned, her heart rate was 90, her blood pressure was 80 over 50, respiratory rate 22, pulse 90, and temperature 98.6. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and, left axis deviation. Her lab results showed elevated troponin and BNP indicative of cardiac muscle cell death and heart failure or what I said to the patient was heart dysfunction. As far as review of systems is concerned, she had orthopnea. She had difficulty breathing at rest, so that puts her at a NYHA score of 4. She had fatigue wheezing, every other ROS for MSK, and, neuro GI was negative or otherwise noted in the EMR. I didn't have a chance to copy it over onto my sheet. She is immunized or up to date on all her immunizations, so we went ahead and, I gave her a consult. As far as her needing to be admitted to the ICU. The nurses will receive instructions regarding vitals to be checked every 2 hours, strict bed rest, also strict monitoring of intake, outtake, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, IV, KBO, she would need BiPAP. We would discontinue all her medications, which I let her know and add the butamine for her blood pressure. I didn't let the patient know that we would need to put her on an insulin scale, but I think that's one necessary to know for, the nursing staff. And she would continue taking Plavix and warfarin. She would need to get repeat labs for troponins and PTINR because she's currently taking warfarin. As far as consult, I let the patient know that she would need a consult to interventional cardiology, for CRT and AICD. Specifically because of the left bundle branch blocking me to reestablish some normal rhythm in her heart. That's it."
"Doing a case presentation on Leslie Palmer. The patient is Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male. He presents to the office with shortness of breath and fatigue. He states that he saw his GP 3 days ago and was referred to the ER today. Patient states his symptoms started 2 weeks ago with heart palpitations that worsen with exercise and improve with rest. He also states near syncope. He denies fevers, chills, and changes in weight. He denies joint pain, muscle pain, and back pain. He also denies skin changes. He also denies vision changes and hearing loss and neck stiffness. He notes some dizziness with the heart palpitations when he's exercising. Past medical history includes hypertension and is taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He denies a surgical history except for cardiac catheterization that was normal. Family history includes his mother who passed away suddenly decades ago, and his father also passed away at age 59 due to MI. He has no nondrug allergies. For his social history, he states that he eats a well balanced diet and walks daily. He denies use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. He drinks a cup of coffee every morning and is an elementary school teacher for 5th grade. And also sexually active. Vato's signs showed a heart rate of 110, which is slightly elevated, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, which is also slightly elevated, but he is taking Lisinopril, A respiratory rate of 16. His temperature was 98.6, and his O2 sat was 96%. Fiscal exam showed negative JVD and bruise. There was an S4 murmur in Gallup and a laterally displaced PMI. Lungs were equal to auscultation bilaterally. No lower extremity edema or calf tenderness, and pulses were present equal and bilateral. Lab showed troponin and BNP within normal limits. A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. Echo showed LVH voltage criteria and tall r's waves and septal leads. Patient was diagnosed with chameleohypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to genetics. The treatment plan for this patient is to admit to telemetry, maintain activity as tolerated, strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and O2 nasal cannula to maintain the O2 set at 96%. You can have a regular diet and will do a Sannie Locker KVO. Patient is to discontinue the Lisinopril and start disopyramide 100 milligrams BID. No further labs and imaging needed. We will consult with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement, and we'll consult with a cardiothoracic surgeon for a future septomyomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce the LVOT. Patient tend to lose weight or maintain healthy weight and not do strenuous activity until released by the physician. Thank you for your time."
"Left the emergency department after seeing miss Leslie Palmer. She is a 62 year old female, who's presenting with symptoms of progressive worsening of shortness of breath and fatigue over the last 2 months. She said she saw her, family doctor about 3 days ago where she received a diagnostic workup but did not get, to review the labs and, diagnostic findings with her PCP. She said she presents today because her symptoms have worsened. She says that she has significant decreases in her activity levels, no longer able to, complete her normal activity. Patient has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she reports compliance with her medications of Lisinopril and prednisone. Reports a maternal history of sudden death, of her mother around 40 years. And her paternal history of death at 59 following, MI. She has no known drug allergies, reports an outpatient cath, procedure about 1 year ago. No complications from that. Her associated symptoms that she's been sitting with today is, about £8, weight gain in the last 2 weeks. Fatigue as I said, she notes some presyncope, as well as palpitations, no chest pain though, associated wheezing, and orthopnea where she says she's now having to lay in her chair to sleep. Notes of edema to her ankles bilaterally. On my exam, she was awake alert and oriented. Her vitals, she was a little low on her o two stats with 91%, percent. BP was a little, elevated 136 over 99. She was a febrile at 98.6 and was a little tacky at 110, respiratory rate of 20. On my exam, didn't hear any carotid roots. JVD was present bilaterally. I heard an s four systolic murmur with no rubs or gallops. PMI was not displaced. Wheezes were present and rails were present. She had no tenderness, was not in acute respiratory distress though. Homan's was negative. No on tender calves. She did have pedal edema, 1 plus. Her pulses were all present. I'm looking at her x-ray. She had mangostinal fullness, pulmonary edema as well as a normal heart size. I discussed this all with the patient as well as going over her echo which was read as restrictive cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction at 95 or 55%. Excuse me. Her EKG, it seemed normal. Maybe, an occurrence of some left ventricular hypertrophy was a little elevated, in the v 5, v 6 leads. Told her it could have been maybe something we wanna repeat on, the EKG at a later time. On the monitor though, I did note a period of non sustained v tax. We talked about that as well, with the patient. Her troponin as well as her CBC and CMP were within normal limits, non diagnostic. But she did have an elevated BNP at, 4,000. So I discussed with patient that I believe that her pulmonary sarcoidosis, history that was about 25 years ago, has likely spread to her heart and is causing her, symptom presentation currently. I would pull the patient the plan to get admitted to telemetry and where we'll get consults for with, interventional cardiology as well as radiology to further, evaluate and work up this patient. Told her about potential for getting a pacemaker placed as well as to get further imaging, with the radiologist. Went through the plans and how she'll be admitted. She said she has insurance and good social support locally. So she was, felt good about that plan to get admitted and have people who would support her. We talked about how she's gonna get some medication, to support her symptoms, try to help alleviate them. So I'm gonna go ahead and diagnose her with or, prescribe her some amiodarone for the noncystine V TAG as well as, Lisinopril. And I'm gonna up her prednisone dosage, since the pulmonary sarcoidosis has seemingly spread to her heart. I'm I'm also gonna get some furosemide to help with the pulmonary edema that she's experiencing. And I'm gonna do a repeat CMP just to make sure that nothing has changed from that."
"For our patient Leslie. She is a 62 year old female Leslie Palmer. She came into the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. She stated this started about 2 weeks ago when she first had flu like symptoms, and, they seem to go away around 5 days ago. But ever since that moment, she has been, quite tired and fatigued, Especially, she said when she goes to the gym, she's not able to do any strenuous activity. So having some exertion, with with dyspnea. She also states that her, she seems to have a dull constant pain on her chest, and, the only way to to make her feel better, especially during the night, is to, to put some put some pillows in backwards, sit on the recliner. So it seems like she's got some orthopnea, going along with the, with the dip snap, then she didn't take any medications in the past. What the only thing that makes it feel better is just resting. I do want to see I do I do wanna go over also her past medical history. She does seem to have a history of hypertension. She was taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams. She stated she had no allergies, but she has had some prior procedures before. She had a cardiac cath about, about about a year ago, due to some abnormal EKGs. But, everything came up okay, and she stated. Other pertinent history, her mom, she died of breast cancer and her dad, currently is 9 years old with dementia. In addition to that, social factors, she usually exercises 2 to 3 days a week, so she is active and eats a balanced, well diet. So it is a little on the stranger side that she has, she's had shortness of breath while trying to exercise. She is a teacher and is married and sexually active as well. When I did the active as well. When I did the review of systems, I did get some pertinent information when it came to general. She she complained of fatigue, some gain of weight. She did have a fever and chills in the past, but not currently. Then skin skin was normal. He and was normal. Then and cardiac RS, she did have palpitations and chest pain. And with lung, she said she complained of shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea, and some wheezing as well. She did also complain that she had, fluid in her extremities. And other than that, the her vitals, they were 130 over 90. Heart rate was 110. Temperature was 98.6. Rescavation rate was 20. Oxygen saturation was 91%, and mean arterial pressure 103. When it comes to the physical exam itself, I have right here. Let's see. She did have a jugular vein distension. In regards to cardiovascular problems, she did have her BMI was displaced laterally. No murmurs, friction rub, or gallops. There did seem to be some rails, precedent, as well, the wheezes. And in regards to her edema, she did have some pial edema. She also had her pulses and her dorsalis pedis, were equal, bilateral. Her x-ray did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, which was explained to her. Did show some on dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction as well. And her EKG shows some, sinus tachy with, left ventricular hypertrophy, and some probably a right bundle branch block. Troponin was elevated. BNP was 4,000. As a whole, she was she was diagnosed with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to the prior history and and the with congestive heart failure. Her New York Heart Association score, it was a 3 due to I'm sorry. It was a 2, as she had limitation only with strenuous physical activity. She was admitted for telemetry. This is a serious case. We wanted to, keep providals every 2 hours. Activity is tolerated. Nursing interventions included daily waits, o 2, cannula, maintaining, o 2 status of 96%, and DVT prophylaxis, strict intake and out output. We wanted to keep the vein open. In regards to medication, we we are allowing for a set of infants, 625 milligrams every 6 hours as needed. Then we have metoprolol, metoprolol and Lisinopril, which were prescribed. So Lisinopril 10 milligrams every day, and then the 50 milligrams, by mouth every day of metoprolol along with furosemide 40 milligrams, IV every 12 hours. Additional labs included, serotroponins, and then also repeat 2 d echo to, take a look at the heart and monitor progress. She was referred to interventional cardiology, infectious diseases, and radiology for, possible AICD placement, CRTD placement, endomyocardial biopsy, media enhanced MRI, and immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, possibly. But that'll be something the specialists will be taking care of. Right. Thank you."
"Presenting to you today a 62 year old female patient, Leslie Palmer, who showed up today to the ER with, chief complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations that started 2 months ago, which has been getting worse. Patients stated to have visited her family medicine provider 3 days ago, but since then, her symptoms have gotten, haven't gotten any better. And I would classify her as a n NYHA classification of 3. Patient stated that she had fatigue and gained £8 since the start of her symptoms. Patient also stated that she had wheezing, orthopnea, and dyspnea with exertion, for her cardiovascular symptoms. She stated that she had palpitations, presyncope, but no chest pain. Her musculoskeletal symptoms were all negative except for swelling in her lower extremities. Otherwise, everything was, else was insignificant for her her ROS. The patient has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis that was diagnosed 25 years ago. The patient had a cardiac cath done a year ago with no significant results. Otherwise, no other hospitalizations. Patient has no known allergies. She stated that she had a balanced diet, used to walk every day with friends, but was unable to nowadays due to her symptoms. She's not taking any illicit drugs, no no tobacco or alcohol. She drinks a cup of coffee every day and is an elementary school teacher. She's also married and has someone to take care of her throughout her medical care, and, she has insurance. Her patient died suddenly at the age of 40, and her father died of a heart attack at the age of 59. For her physical exam, I noted a positive jugular venous distension, but no carotid bruise, no rashes, no petechiae, no purpura. She had bibasilar rails and wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was normal with no chest wall tenderness. She had a, positive one pitting lower extremity edema and had a full and equal posterior tibial pulses. Her cap was nontender. Her heart was regular with a systolic murmur of s 4. No pericardial friction rub, but positive for gallops. She had a heart rate of a 110, respiratory rate of 20, blood pressure of 136 over 99, pulse was 108, and her temperature was 98.6, degrees Fahrenheit. For her lab, she only had elevated BNP levels, chest x ratio infiltration in her lungs, a widened mediastinum, and a normal sized heart. The echo resulted, result showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus and access with a nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. So patient the patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and she'll be admitted to the hospital. Patient will be continuing her Lisinopril, 10 milligrams. I increased her prednisone to 60 milligrams, and then I added an amiodarone 150 milligrams IV and furosemide 40 milligrams IV. I'll be ordering CNP Labs for her, and I will also be consulting, consulting interventional cardiology for an I AICD placement and radiology for a FEG PET scan. Patient will also be given oxygen via, the nasal cannula to maintain her oxygen saturation above 96%. And I counseled the patient on maintaining a low sodium diet and not getting out of bed without assistance. Thank you."
"Case presentation on the patient that I just saw, miss Leslie. So she went to her PCP about 3 days ago complaining of shortness of breath, tiredness, fluttering in her heart, as well as some feelings of about to pass out. She didn't actually pass out as her breathing can be feelings. Her PCP told us if any told her if anything got worse to come see us, and he also ordered her X-ray, labs, echo, and EKG. So we're gonna go over those with her. I went over them with her. Sorry. 3, 2, 1. Go. Hi, doctor Robbins. This is doctor Jerm McAuley. I just wanna give you a case presentation on the patient I just saw, miss Leslie. So she went to her PCP about 3 days ago with complaints of shortness of breath, tiredness, flutterings in her heart as well as presyncope feelings. Her doctor went ahead and ordered labs, chest X-ray, echo, and EKG, and we're gonna cover those results with the patient today, which is why I did. And she came to the ED as instructed by her doctor as her symptoms were getting worse. So this all began about 2 months ago, and she is no longer able to do really any activity without the pain. Sorry. Not the pain. Her symptoms getting worse. She likes to sit in her recliner as well as rest to help with her symptoms. She says that it gets worse when she's laying flat as well as being moving in any sort of activity. So her past medical history consists of high blood pressure and pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed 25 years ago. She had a cardiac cath 1 year ago. No complications. Nothing significant from that. My family medical history for her mom was sudden death at 40, and her father died, with a heart attack at 59. For social history, she does not use alcohol, not use tobacco, never uses drugs, never has before. She is currently employed as a 4th grade teacher. Cup of coffee. She used to exercise regularly 5 times a week with a walking group of her friends, but did her symptoms, she's no longer able to do that. She is living with her husband. She currently takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day as well as prednisone 10 milligrams once a day for sarcoidosis, Lisinopril for her high blood pressure. She has no drug allergies. She does have an unexplained weight gain of about £8 over the past 2 weeks. Her ROS per scan and AT and T were both negative. For her cardiovascular, we talked about her palpitations she's been experiencing, and she also had the feelings of presyncity like we already talked about. For pulmonary, she has been having some wheezing as well as the dipsy and orthopnea. For MSK, she's had the lower extremity edema, and she's had some light headedness feeling. Today, she presented awake, alert, and oriented. Her vital signs were as follows. Temperature was 98.6. Heart rate, 110. Respiratory rate, 20. Blood pressure, 136 over 90. S v o 2, 91%. She had no, carotid bruit. She did have JVD bilaterally. She had a regular heart rate. She did have an s 4 murmur when I was listening on the mitral valve, and her PMI was normal. Bilaterally, she did have wheezing and rales with an auscultation of her lungs. For the extremities, her calves were nontender. She did have pedal edema in both feet, plus 1, as well as her pulses were equal and normal. No Hoffman's son. For her imaging, upon excuse me. Looking at her chest x-ray, she had mediastinal fullness and pulmonary edema in a normal sized heart. And looking at her echo, they said that the diagnosis was restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness, ejection fraction 55%. Looking at her EKG, her it was normal sinus rhythm, but she did have some non sustained b tach. Her labs are normal for troponin and elevated for BNP at 4,000. So given all the information of her history, physical exam, and the imaging and labs, I diagnosed her with sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. She had a New York Heart Association functional classification of 3, and I told her we're going to admit her to telemetry for her serious condition, and we're gonna check her vitals every 2 hours. She can get out of bed with assistance. Strict IO. Daily weight will be monitored. DVT prophylaxis, giving her some oxygen to help keep her stats. That's about 98% with the nursing interventions. Keep her on a low sodium diet and IV fluids, KBO. No pain medication. We were gonna start on amiodarone to help with her non sustained V TAC. Felicinopril is finally keep taking for high blood pressure, and then her prognizome are going to increase to help with sarcoidosis in her heart and lungs. We also are gonna add furosemide to help with the the edema she's experiencing. And then we're going to consult interventional cardiologist to talk about an ACDI placement and a radiologist to do a, FDG PET scan to look at her heart better. And that's it."
"And I am presenting to you today the case that I saw in the emergency room. I saw a 62 year old female. She she came in with the chief complaint of shortness and breath and fatigue. She reports that this the onset of this occurred around 2 weeks ago, which she reported to her family medicine practice. They advised that she come in to be examined. She did report that, she is experiencing dyspnea and, paroxysmal orthopnea, which, her dyspnea is worsened by, strenuous activity or being active, whereas her orthopnea is worsened by laying down. Rest relieves her dyspnea and her, her orthopnea is relieved where she has to prop herself up on pillows especially when she's sleeping. She also reports that during exertion she does feel presyncable episodes, coming on and as well as she has, she's significant for palpitations. The patient was alert alert and coherent. However, she was fatigued and, pretty concerned about her current condition. Our review of systems yielded, she was negative for chest pain. She again was positive for palpitations and syncope. She denied wheezing or coughing, just dyspnea and orthopnea was positive. Her she did report that she did experience, edema, impending edema specifically, and her past medical history is significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams for, and she is also significant for hypertension, which she takes 10 milligrams of Lisinopril for. She does report that she is consistent with her medication and she uses it as prescribed. Her mother is also, her family has revealed that her mother did die suddenly of an unexplained cause at 40 years old, and then her father did die at 59 years old from, from a ischemic cardiac event. She does report that she has no non drug allergies. Upon physical exam, it yielded that she was tachycardic, she had a heart rate of 110, her o2 or her pulse ox was 91%, her respiration was 20 beats per minute, she was mildly hypertensive, she was 130 over 90, and you know continuing with the physical exam, she, pulses were intact bilateral, there was no there were no Baruis present, and auscultation did yield a cardiac murmur, and there was bilateral rails, as well as pitting edema present. Chest x-ray did, you know, reviewing the chest x-ray, it did reveal pulmonary edema as well as mediastinal mediastinal fullness and pulmonary infiltrates, which were detected, which were positive for a Paulinberger sign. Her echocardiogram did yield that there was, thickening, and there was a preserved ejection fraction, of the heart, and her EKG did demonstrate that there was, non sustained ventricular tachycardia. So regarding her labs, her BMP was also significantly elevated to 4,000. And this was discussed with the patient as far as the clinical findings are concerned, so, given this information I would say her, she also reports that she is a non smoker, non drinker, she's fairly active which is how she noticed that something was going on. So regarding this information, I do believe that she is suffering from sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and I would classify her as a New York Heart Association Class 3. She has a secondary diagnosis of hypertension as well as pulmonary edema, and my plan for this patient is to admit to telemetry. I want to consult with interventional cardiology as well as radiology, so we can go ahead and see if there may be a need for a pacemaker or we could also get a fed pet. Additionally, as far as orders are concerned, she could be activity as monitored activity or support. She's going to be on nasal cannula, and I like to start DVT prophylaxis as well as strict IO and daily weights. Additionally, I would like to continue clisinopril. However, I would like to increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams. And then I would also like to start her on, amiodarone 150 so it can improve her cardiac output. And also for referred, SVT. And as far as lifestyle modifications are concerned, you know, as long as she maintains healthy weight, diet, and weight reduction, she may be able to, you know when she meets with, intervention interventional cardiology and nuclear medicine, she may be able to, you know have a better, or an improved outcome. Thank you so much, and I look, I look, forward to just asking this case with you. Bye."
"Okay. Good afternoon. So we have a 60 year old woman who's presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient has experienced flu like symptoms days prior to arrival. She states that her breathing is labored and sleeps in her recliner to alleviate the symptoms of shortness of breath. Her activity level has drastically decreased and her symptoms improve upon rest. She had a fever, cough, and runny nose which has since subsided days prior. Patient also has chest pain, slight palpitations, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patient denies syncope and abnormal skin rashes or lesions. On further review of symptoms, patient does complain of wheezing and swelling in her lower legs. The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension in which she is currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams by mouth daily, and the patient denies consuming alcohol, using illicit drugs, and smoking any tobacco products. Her vital signs that were within normal limits included the blood pressure, which was 130 over 90, and her temperature, which was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Her elevated vital signs included the heart rate, which was 110, and respiratory rate, which was 20. Her oxygen saturation level was decreased. It read 91%. And on physical exam, pinning edema was shown in her lower extremities and also rails and wheezing were noted during lung auscultation. Hypertension, actually primary assessment is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to previous viral infection. However, hypertension could be provided as a secondary assessment and the plan to treat these symptoms would be to admit the patient to telemetry units just for monitoring and we also want to begin nursing to have her on a strict IO to do daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and to place the, patient on the o two nasal cannula to increase the oxygen saturation to 96%. And, also, we wanna give her medications with Lisinopril, acetaminophen, and furosemide. Wanna do 10 milligrams by mouth of Lisinopril, 625 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours of acetaminophen, and 40 milligrams of furosemide IV. And because she's on furosemide, we wanna make sure we order a CNP because her troponin levels were also high and her BNP was also high. We wanna make sure we order troponin levels to be monitored and to do a repeat echocardiogram. That's her chest x-ray and her echo showed her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly and the echo showed the left ventricular ejection fraction weight was below 30%, and we also want to have interventional cardiology follow her as well as infectious disease and radiology. She's gonna get a, contrast enhanced MRI of her heart as well as, be put on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids because of the infection, and we would like to, look at a endomyocardial biopsy as well as CRTD and AICD, which are just the pacemaker and defibrillation, and we will have the patient continue to be monitored and checked every 2 hours while on the floor. Thank you."
"Leslie Walker. He's a 62 year old male that presents with shortness of breath and fatigue. He is a current smoker, and he currently has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and, atrial fibrillation. I did a physical exam on him, and he shows, wheezing and bibasilar Rawls as well as some jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema. He also stated that he is having trouble laying down. So he having trouble laying down breathing, so I believe he's got some orthopedic, some dyspnea going on as well, and he states that these symptoms are going on at rest. I looked at his X-ray. His X-ray showed some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, and then I looked at his lab results and saw that his BNP is, severely elevated showing some fluid buildup in the heart as well as an elevated troponin, which shows some damage to the heart that's going on. I believe what's going on is, ischemic heart disease. I think the next best step in his treatment should be, to admit him to the ICU. I believe that we should have him follow-up with the cardiologist for a possible AICD placement and or CRTD placement. I would like to start keep him on his clopidogrel and warfarin and add dobutamine as an ionotrope to help his heart, beat a little better, and we can go in together and see him now. Right? Thank you."
"I'm here today reporting about 62 year old patient who came came in complaining about shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. That started about 3 days ago, and it has been constant level of discomfort since then. Patient mentioned she had a flu like symptoms about 2 weeks ago but recovered fully. Patient states the discomfort level is mainly in the chest area, and she is unable to sleep in bed, so she has been sleeping in recliner. Patient also states she has, shortness of breath, shortness of breath at rest. Patient, as well as patient states the severity of discomfort as 2 out of 10. Patient has past past medical history of hypertension and currently taking lisinopril to manage that and has no not known drug allergy as well as no past surgical history. Patient mom passed away of breast cancer and father is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and currently in nursing facility. Patient is an elementary school teacher and currently lives with her husband. Upon review of upon conducting review of system, patient mentioned to have fatigue, weight gain, about 8 pound, lower extremity swelling, chest pain, palpitation, wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patient virus were slightly elevated to stage 1 hypertension and was tachycardic. Upon conducting full physical exam, I found patient to have j JVD distension, carot carotid root, but no murmur, friction rub, or gallop. Patient also had wheezing and bilateral grills present upon, ausculting her lungs. Patient had pereledema as well, but no chest wall tenderness. X-ray results showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. 2 d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. EKG results showed sinusachycardia with a right bundle branch block. Patient lab test also showed elevated troponin and BNP. Based on all these available test and clinical examination, a Duchenne patient had myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and admitted her to telemetry. Based on patient based on patient, information, I also sent her class 4 heart failure. I'm also adding 625 mg acetaminophen and 40 mg IV fluoroosamide to her medications along with continuation of 10 mg lisinopril. I'm also ordering serial troponin and CMP lab test as well as repeat of 2 d echo. I am setting her up to have consultation with interventional cardiology to discuss about potentially placing, any device placement as well as doing an endomyocardial biopsy. I'm also setting her up with infectious disease to go over about the immunoglobulin route for vertigo to better manage her condition right now. And radiologist for MRI. I shared all of this information with the care team and discussed about necessary to recheck all her initial vitals as well as check vitals every 2 hours. I'm also advised low sodium diet for now. That's all I have for now. Thank you very much."
"Leslie Parker is a 62 year old female who presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. She reports a recent illness about 2 weeks ago with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her fever and cough resolved about 5 days ago, but she's still experiencing dyspnea worsened with exertion and lying flat. She's a past medical history of hypertension, which is treated with Lisinopril 10 milligrams. She has no known drug allergies. In terms of her past family history, her mother passed from breast cancer and her father has Alzheimer's dementia. She eats a balanced diet, does not drink alcohol, and does not use tobacco. She exercises regularly and has moderate caffeine intake. In addition to her fatigue and dyspnea, she reports recent waist gain, muscle soreness, lower extremity swelling, a dull constant chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, and wheezing. Upon physical exam, I noted jugular venous distension, but no carotid bruise. Her heart auscultation did not reveal any murmurs or gallops. Her PMI was laterally displaced, but she had no chest wall tenderness. Her lung auscultation revealed bibasilar rails and wheezing. Upon evaluation of her lower extremities, she had 1 plus pitting edema. However, her dorsalospetus and posterior tibialis pulses were full and equal and her calves were nontender. Her labs and imaging revealed increased troponin and a BNP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. And her echo showed a dilated left ventricle with decreased ejection fraction. Her EKG showed tachycardia with a right bundle branch block. Based on these findings and my her clinical history and my physical exam, this patient most likely has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I would recommend admitting to telemetry. Activity is tolerated with a low sodium diet. She should continue her Lisinopril. We should add furosemide 40 milligrams IV and acetaminophen 625 milligrams for pain. We should consult with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD and a biopsy for definitive diagnosis. We should also consult with infectious disease for possible use of immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids. And we should consult with radiology for enhanced cardiac MRI to better view the inflammation in her heart."
"62 year old male patient presented with shortness of breath and fatigue. He stated that the symptoms started around 6 months ago, and have progressively worsened. He noted that he went to his PCP 3 days ago and felt the need to come to the ER due to his extensive cardiovascular history. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, all of which have been, treated with prescription medications thus far. He has had an open heart surgery. He's said around 12 years ago, a CABG in a stent, each so he's had I'm sorry. He's had one stent for the past 5 years. And he also noted that he has been told that he has left access deviation in less than 40%, ejection fracture on, fraction on ultrasound, that he obtained last year. Regarding his family. His mother passed away at the age of 80 years old from breast cancer. His father is 82 years old and has Alzheimer's, currently living in a nursing home. So the patient, a little bit about him personally. He does not drink alcohol. He, has smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for the past 30 years and notes that he is not ready to quit when asked, and he does not use illicit drugs drugs. He does not have a history of it either. He states that, he eats a balanced diet, drinks 1 cup of coffee a day, and he used to walk with friends several times a week that he has not been able to recently due to his shortness of breath. He is a 5th grade teacher, is married, and lives with significant others. Other notes that he has a great support system. He also, states that he stated that he does not have any allergies and takes upper medications daily of which are atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, POQD, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, POQD, furosemide, 20 milligrams, PO BID, metoprolol, second aid, 50 milligrams, POQD, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, POQD, metformin, 500 milligrams, POQD, and warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, PO BID. So once again, he complains of, complains of, fatigue even at RAS now, at 8 pound weight gain over the past 2 weeks, beezing, and shortness of breath. He notes that he, does not have any skin changes. No heat changes, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, AS MSK, or neuro, complications either. So that said, on exam, he was awake, oriented, and and fatigued. He does not have a fever did not have a fever. He had a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. His blood pressure was 80 over 50, and his oxygen was at, 86%. He had a positive JVD, no bruise. He had wheezing wheezing and RAILs on lung auscultation, pedal edema, but no tenderness. And, importantly, he had a displaced PMI laterally. X rays showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Ultrasound showed decreased ejection fraction, and the EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, LVH, voltage criteria in a left bundle branch block. Labs had elevated troponin and a BNP of 4,000. Overall, I assessed that he was a New York Heart Association class 4. Together, the patient and I discussed that he had ischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy, and it's essentially just progression of his previous heart condition. And we decided that we will admit him to the ICU due to his serious condition and check his vitals every 2 hours. He will be on bed rest, and the nurse will be notified or has been notified that he will have strict IO, take daily weights, and maintain DVT prophylaxis. He will have a low sodium diet, KBO, IV fluids, and we discontinued all of his medications, like, stuff like clopidogrel in the warfarin. We started him on dobutamine, IV drip, and in insulin sliding scale for his diabetes. We also started him on BiPAP, and we will check his INT and serial troponins frequently. I'm sorry. Not INT. What am I talking about? INR because he's taking, warfarin. Overall, we referred him to an original cardiologist for IACD or CRT placement. That's it. Thank you."
"Today, I'm presenting on miss Palmer, who is a 6062 year old female, who presented to the ED with complaints of some chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Miss Palmer said that she saw her family physician a few days ago with similar symptoms, unresolved, and if symptoms worsen to go to the ED. Miss Palmer said a few weeks ago, she had flu like symptoms with fever, cough, runny nose, and shortness of breath and fatigue. Most of those symptoms went away a few days ago, other than the shortness of breath and fatigue. Miss Palmer said that she uses, pillows to sleep, so she's elevated. And she has no try no treatments, and the only alleviating factor for her shortness of breath is to sit upright. She continued to go into the gym after her flu like symptoms, but eventually had to stop due to her symptoms worsening. And she said that her symptoms get a lot worse with exercise and moderate activity, but day to day activities are mainly unaffected. The patient presented with increased heart rate at a 110 and a decreased oxygen saturation. Surgical history includes a cardiac catheterization procedure about a year ago. The patient told me that there's no medical history, though they are on Lisinopril, which, leads me to believe that the patient does have hypertension. The patient has a diet and does moderate exercise weekly about 2 to 3 times a week. The mother has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old, and the father has dementia and is currently in a nursing home. Review systems, included a well well developed well nurse patient who is fatigued and in pain and has gained £8 since 2 weeks ago. This may be due to her lower extremity edema and swelling and, myalgia, which was shown on the physical exam. The patient complained of heart fluttering and had heart palpitations and a laterally displaced PMI. The patient complained of wheezed wheezing and coughing and, dyspnea and orthopnea, with orthopnea being worse. The physical ulcer showed JVD with no, no carotid breweries. Permanent lab results showed elevated troponin and BNP. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. The 2 d echo ultrasound showed, dilated cardiomyopathy in the left ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%, and EKG showed sinus tachycardia with the right bundle branch block. So based on this information, I believe that the state the patient had myocarditis that caused dilated cardiomyopathy due to viral cause. The New York Heart Association stage is, stage 2 with heart failure with reduced rejection. Reduced ejection fraction at 30%. My plan is to admit this patient to the telemetry unit and keep their Lisinopril, add acetaminophen and furosemide at 40 milligrams IV, acetaminophen at 625 milligrams, orally. We're gonna consult interventional cardiology for, defibrillator and AICD placement, and also do a right ventricular biopsy. We wanna consult infectious disease for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoid treatment and get a radiologist contrast media enhanced MRI. We wanna do strict IOs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, o two, via nasal cannula to get the oxygen back up to above 96%. Other than that, we wanna do a serial troponin again and repeat the echo and also get CMP. The patient had no questions upon the consult upon my consultation and advising them after their treatment plan and, physical findings."
"The patient I just saw in the ED, I saw a 60 year old female who presented to the emergency room today with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. The onset of the shortness of breath and fatigue began, over the last 6 months and has been gradually worsening. The patient states that she is even short of breath at rest and symptoms are worsening with any and all physical activity. Patient states that she has been sleeping in a chair in her recliner at night and is unable to walk with her friends anymore due to her symptoms. Patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her social history includes that she is a one pack per day smoker for the past 30 years. Her medications include Lisinopril 10 milligrams, metropolososanide, 50 milligrams, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, metformin, 500 milligrams, furosemide, 2.5 milligrams. She has no known drug allergies. Mother died of breast cancer and father currently has Alzheimer's and is living in a nursing facility. Patient surgical history includes a CABG and stents. Through the review of systems and the physical exam findings, patient was fatigued and recently gained weight 8 pounds within the last 2 weeks. Skin testing was negative. HE ENT was positive for, GVD. Her cardio revealed, tachycardia with a split s 2, a displaced, PMI, but no murmurs, gallops, or, frictional rubs. Pulmonary testing revealed by bilateral rails, orthogmia, dyspypnea with exertion and wheezing. MSK, revealed lower extremity edema, negative for all neurological testing. Her labs, her vitals included a heart rate of 90, a low blood pressure of 80 over 50, and SpO 2 level of 86, very low. Her troponin level came back slightly elevated at 0.4. Her BNP was also elevated at 4,000. So the diagnosis for this patient is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which would be due to her medical history, particularly her hyperlipidemia and her smoking history contributing. Plan is to admit to the ICU, and diagnosis includes a n h a NYHA, functional classification of level 4 condition is serious allergies. No known. Vitals q2 hours. Activity strict bed rest. Nursing instructions include, strict intravenous, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis. Her diet is restricted to low sodium. IV fluids or KVO keep being open. Medications where you're holding all existing medications except for clobidogrel, 75 milligrams, her warfarin 2.5. We will be adding a dopamine IV drip and, replacing her metformin with an insulin sliding scale. Respiratory therapy includes BiPAP. And for labs and imaging, I'm doing, serial troponin levels and a PTINR for her warfarin. The specialists I'd like to consult are the interventional cardiologist for a either a CRTD or AICD placement. And, that is everything for the 60 year old patient who came into the ED today and presented with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Thank you very much."
"Patient is 62 year old, mister Leslie Palmer. He presents with a 6 month history of shortness of breath and fatigue. He has symptoms even at rest and has recently been sleeping in his armchair at night due to orthopnea. Symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and fatigue increase with any kind of activity and return to baseline at rest. He has also noticed an 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks and has noticed swelling in his lower extremities. In terms of medical history, he has a long standing history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, for which he is taking atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. In terms of surgical interventions, he has had open heart surgery with a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graft 12 years ago and has had 5 stents with the most recent one being a year ago in the left anterior descending descending artery. He is not amenable to further surgical intervention. His mother passed due to breast cancer, and his father is currently in a medical facility for Alzheimer's disease. In terms of social history, mister Palmer does not take in partake in illicit drugs or alcohol. He does have one cup of coffee each morning with breakfast and does have a one a 30 pack year history of tobacco use. He works as an elementary school teacher, and claims to have a balanced diet. He also walks regularly, though recently he has found this difficult due to his symptoms. Upon physical examination, mister Palmer was found to have jugular venous distension, tachycardia with a split s 2, a laterally displaced PMI, and was positive for a gallop. Lung auscultation revealed, wheezing and RAILs. He had pitting edema in the lower extremities, but the bilateral, radial, and dorsalis pedis pulses were strong. Pertinent vital signs include a heart rate of 90, a blood pressure of 80 over 50, respiratory rate of 22, and o two stat of, 86%. After review of labs, imaging, and history, they suggested I suggested an ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. All the patient's medications were terminated except for clifidogrel and warfarin. We started him on dobutamine and admitted him to the ICU where he will be put on an insulin sliding scale and will be on a BiPAP machine. He was referred to interventional interventional cardiology for AICD placement and CRTD placement. He was also consulted about social supports and financial supports before being dismissed. Thank you so much."
"Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, and orthopnea following a cold that began 2 weeks ago. The patient states she is unable to exercise due to the dyspnea with and which occurs with slight activity. Patient takes 10 milligrams of Lisinopril QD for hypertension and states she had a routine cardiac cath 1 year ago. No known drug allergies, alcohol, or drug use were reported. Patient admits to an 8 pound weight gain over the past 2 weeks with heart palpitations. Heart rate was 110. O two was 91. Respiratory rate was 20. Pulse was 110. BP was 130 over 90, and temp was normal. Physical exam findings were positive for JVD, a laterally displaced PMI, bibasilar rails, wheezing, and a one plus pitting edema in lower extremities. Posterior tibial pulses were full and equal. Troponin and BNP levels were elevated, and EKG showed a right bundle branch block with sinus tachycardia. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and an echo showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%. Patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and will be admitted to telemetry. Patient will be placed on nasal cannula with 2 liters per minute of oxygen flow with oxygen stats being maintained above 96%. Patient will continue taking her Lisinopril as prescribed, be given 625 milligrams of acetaminophen PO q 6 hours for chest pain, and IV furosemide 40 milligrams q 12 hours for edema. Interventional cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology were consulted."
"Report on a patient I saw in, clinic today. Mister Leslie Palmer, presented today, with complaints of, some shortness of breath, some fluttering, wheezing, near syncope, upon walking with friends for approximately 45 minutes. Patient states that, it's been happening now for a couple of weeks. They do not have any pain or any coughing, though. The symptoms do are are alleviated with rest. It's really just the the walking extensive amounts of time or any, larger exertions, cause that near syncope. Patient said that they are able to do everyday activities around the house, without any, symptoms. But they said when they do have those symptoms, they would rate it a a 10, that it was, absolutely terrible. They they felt like they would absolutely, pass out, without rest. So, looking a little bit more into the patient's history, their, mother does, or had a sudden death at the age of 40. Their father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 69. The patient himself, did present with hypertension, and he was taking Lisinopril for that, 10 milligrams. But, he also does not have any allergies, to any drugs. Patients say that they haven't been hospitalized for anything, but they did have, a heart cath approximately a year ago. It was an outpatient procedure, and, all the results came back normal. No other surgeries other than that. Patient said that they do have a balanced diet. They exercise pretty regularly, but obviously they've been limited now with, the oncoming of symptoms with exercise. They report, and that was, 3 to 4 times a week typically before, symptoms caught on. They report no drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use. Normal caffeine intake, about a a cup of coffee a day. They are, employed as a 7th grade math teacher, and they are, married, to a man, monogamous relationship of 22 years. Patient reports, no general, findings, no, skin findings for review of systems, no musculoskeletal, no h e e n t, no neuro findings. Patient does, as I said before, complain of of flutter near syncope, but, without any chest pain. Patient does have shortness of breath and wheezing. The shortness of breath is, when they're standing, upon exertion. It's not specifically when they lie down. Presenting today, they had they're slightly tachycardic with a heart rate of a 110, which I discussed with them as, being possible that it's a a pathology, but also with the, with the idea of white coat syndrome, it could have easily been, just because of their current presentation. Their oxygen saturation was 96%, and their blood pressure upon presentation was 130 over 90, with a normal temperature of 98.6 and normal respirations of 16. With the patient's presentation and physical exam, with physical exam findings, I did find that they had pinchedema, my my opinion edema of the lower extremity. I did, hear the bilateral rails. I I heard the wheezing. I heard, upon examination of the aorta and the, PMI, I didn't find any aortic aneurysm, but I did, find a displaced PMI laterally bilaterally. And upon my osteopathic was negative. And upon my physical exam as a whole, I did come to the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis for mister Palmer, was familiar familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I did inform him that that, that could be a cause of his, mother's unfortunate passing. And it is something that's inherited typically. I I admitted mister Palmer, to telemetry, so he can have constant heart monitoring. And, I, switching his medication, I did not note it on the, on the form, but I I have notified the nurse that I'm switching the medication from Lisinopril to disapiramide. And I am going to have his vitals checked every 2 hours. We're going to refer him to the cardiologist for a, for a, pacemaker placement and as well as to the cardiothoracic surgeon for a possible myomectomy or, alcohol injection to, to help with that septal hypertrophy. I reviewed his results. He understood the EKG findings, of left ventricular hypertrophy as well as, the X-ray finding of cardiomegaly as well as the echo. So, mister Leslie was alert. He was well, and oriented, and, he had no further questions regarding my workup. And, yeah, I I told him that he would follow-up with you. And if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. He's a pleasant dude, and, hopefully, he gets up and at him, sooner rather than later. Thanks."
"Mean, mister Leslie Palmer, a 62 year old male who presents to the ER with dyspnea and orthopenia and fatigue. He believes it's been going on for 6 months and it's gotten progressively worse. He went to his family physician. Last week, they had run some labs, but they have not given him any updates on that. So he came in today because he felt more worse. He does not, he used to work out, but he's not alleviated by rest now. So he's been lessening his working out, and he is a NYHA class, 4 candidate because of the rest, and he only can sleep in his chair. But laying down flat makes it worse. His vitals were 98.6 temperature. His heart rate was 90. His blood pressure was 80 over 50. His respiratory rate was 22, and his o two stat was 86. His social history is good, but he's still a pack a day smoker and a moderate, caffeine user with 1 cup a day. And he lives with his wife for 30 years. He feels well supported and happy with her. He also is a a school teacher for 8th grade, and he feels that he likes his job. His medical history that's pertinent is that he has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. His diabetes, he feels is well regulated by his medication. He is on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, metformin, 500 milligrams a day, flurosemide, 20 milligrams a day, metopropyl succinate, 50 milligrams a day, and warfarin, 2.5 milligrams a day. He has had a history of, CABG and 5 stents over the past 5 years. His cardiologist says that he does not want to do anymore since his last stent was June 2022. His father has history as Alzheimer's who is still with us and in a nursing home right now. His mother died from breast cancer 5 years ago, and his physical exam showed a positive for JBD, plus 1 pitting edema in his lower extremity, and his pulses were equal. His, DP and PT pulses were equal. He has bilateral rails and wheezing present on his evaluation. No murmur or rub. Plus g tachycardia split s 1. EKG showed a left bundle branch block with LVH criteria, normal sinus rhythm. His troponin levels were point 04 elevated. BMP was 4,000. It was elevated, and his check's x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo showed dilated left ventricular, with, 30% ejection fraction. We all agreed we I believe I should admit him to the ICU, So that is what we did. We're gonna have to bring in an interventional cardiologist who can do an AICD and a CRTD. We are gonna put him on dobutamine and take off his other medications. He can stay on clopidogrel and warfarin. We'd like to stop every other medication and put him on insulin sliding scale, give him a BiPAP for that 8602. Take put him on a low sodium diet, strict bed rest, and monitor serial, troponins. Thank you."
"Presenting with the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. He was alert, awake, and oriented, but obviously fatigued. He stated that these symptoms have become progressively worse over the last 6 months. Mister Palmer states that all activity exacerbates his shortness of breath and fatigue, and he does confirm that he's still having symptoms at rest. He states that lying flat worsens his condition, nothing improves it, and that he has been sleeping in his chair at night. His respiratory rate was high at 22, his blood pressure was low at 80 over 50, and his oxygen saturation was low at 86%. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, for which he takes Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. Warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, twice a day. Klopidogrel, 75 milligrams, once a day. Metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day. Atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day. Furosemide, 20 milligrams twice a day. And metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams once a day. And the patient also reported a triple bypass previously, and that he's had 5 stents with the last being in June 2022 for a left anterior descending occlusion. The patient said that, at that time, his physician told him he was not going to be a candidate for any more procedures, and he's had no other hospitalizations besides for those cardiac procedures. He has a maternal family history of terminal breast cancer and a paternal family history of Alzheimer's. The patient did endorse fatigue and 8 pound weight gain over 2 weeks, wheezing, dysypnea, orthopnea, and edema of the lower extremities today. His physical exam exam showed JVD without carotid bruit, tachycardia with a split s 2, laterally displaced PMI, by basilar rails and wheezing on auscultation of his lungs. He had a, plus 1 pitting edema with intact distal pulses and nontender calves in his lower extremities. His labs showed a troponin of 0.04 and a BNP of 4,000, both of which are high. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His two d echo showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%, and his EKG showed a left axis displacement with a left bundle branch block. I diagnosed him today with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to his previous cardiac history, his physical exam, and the labs I got back today, as well as that imaging. He is a New York Heart Assess Association stage 4 and should be admitted to the ICU. His condition is serious. He has no known drug allergies. I'd like him to have vitals every 2 hours, strict bed rest, strict input output, daily weights, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. I'd like him on a low sodium diet. I'd like him on an IV fluid protocol of fluid lock. Keep vein open. I'm going to hold all meds except his clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day, and his warfarin 2.5 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to add a dobutamine IV drip and an insulin sliding scale. The patient should be on BiPAP with an input of 16 and an output of 6. I would like him to have serial troponins to monitor his, troponin levels since it was high earlier. And I'd like him to continue having, PTINRs to monitor his clotting as we have him on both clopidogrel and warfarin. I will be consulting interventional cardiology to discuss the possible placement of a CRTD or an AICD. And then after discharge, the patient will be instructed to maintain a healthy diet, wait, and then avoid strenuous activity until he is released by his cardiologist. Overall, I think his outlook looks pretty good, and, please go see him whenever you're ready. Thank you."
"Palmer is a 62 year old male who presented to the clinic today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. His vitals show a blood pressure of 80 over 50, a heart rate of 90, SpO 2 of 86, pulse of 90, and temperature of 98.6. Mister Palmer stated that these symptoms have been going on for the past 6 months and have worsened progressively. He visited his primary care physician a few days ago and symptoms have exponentially worsened since. He states he is unable to perform any physical activities as he experienced extreme shortness of breath, but is okay at rest. He states that he cannot breathe when laying down and laying down to sleep and therefore has to sleep upright. Patient denies any pain, and no medication were taken to help with the symptoms. Patient does not has not experienced anything like this before and rates his discomfort at a 10 out of 10. Review of symptoms showed showed fatigue, weight gain, wheezing, orthopnea, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. Mister Palmer's other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation for which he takes metoprolol, 50 milligrams once a day, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day, metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day, bureausamide, 20 milligrams twice a day, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams once a day, and warfarin, 2.5 milligrams twice a day. He has a history of a tertiary bypass performed 12 years ago and 5 stents placed, one of which was a left anterior descending stent placed in June of 2022. Patient has no pertinent family history. Patient's social history includes a balanced diet with moderate caffeine intake, no alcohol or illicit drug consumption. Patient antiseomokes 1 pack per day for the past 30 years and appropriate counseling was provided. Patient is married and has a stable occupation. Pertinent physical exam findings include positive jugular venous distension with no breathies, heart auscultation revealed tachycardia with a split s 2 and no murmurs. Palpit palpation revealed a laterally displaced PMI and no chest wall tenderness. Lung auscultations revealed by basilar reals and weaving with plus 1 pitting edema noted with full pulses and negative Hellman sign or CAC tenderness. OM examination reveal no tar changes or tenderness upon palpation of Chapman's points. Labs include elevated troponin at 0.4 and elevated BNP at 4,000. X rays show cardiomygaly and pulmonary edema. Echorevial dilated chambers with an ejection fraction of less than 30%, and EKGs reveal normal sinus rhythm, meeting left voltage left high left ventricle hypertrophy voltage criteria and left bundle branch block. The likely diagnosis in this case is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mister Palmer was counsel was counseled on his smoking habits and advised that this may worsen the problem. The patient was also advised that this condition is likely due to his past cardiac medical history. The patient was admitted to telemetry and has a NYHA for classification. All current medications will be withheld except clopidogrel and warfarin and dobutamine and an insulin signing scale will be started. Patient was on BiPAP to assist with oxygenation. A PT, INR, and serial troponin will be reordered and monitored. Patient is on strict bed rest with IO daily weights, monitoring DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, and KBO. Vitals will be checked q two h. Interventional cardiology was consulted, and a patient will be taken for AICD and CRTD placement. Thank you."
"Okay. 65 year old female, miss Palmer, reports to the emergency department today with complaints of shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue. Her onset has been worsening for the past 2 months, but it's gotten especially bad in the past 3 days since visiting with her primary care physician on Friday. She was advised to go to the emergency department because of her symptoms. She's comfortable at rest, awake, alert, and oriented, and also reports multiple episodes of near syncope, within the past 2 months. She has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Her past med her pass surgical history includes a heart catheter that she said that it was normal. Her mom passed away at 40 years old, sudden sudden death, and her father passed away at 59 years old from myocardial infarction. Her social she has a well balanced diet. She enjoys going on walks. No illicit drug use. No tobacco. No alcohol. She's currently an elementary school teacher. She reports having one cup of coffee per day before work so she can get through. And she's been married for the past 30 years, had has one sexual partner. So her current medications include Lisinopril and, prednisone for the sarcoidosis and, Lisinopril for the hypertension. She has no known drug allergies. She reported fatigue. So the only pertinent positives for her review systems were fatigue, palpitations, wheezing, and lower extremity swelling, especially, the groin or ankles. Her physical findings were positive for JBD, positive for or negative for bruise, positive for palpitations, and there was a murmur present, an early systolic murmur. She reported wheezing and by basilar rails on, auscultation. She re lower extremity edema was found on physical exam as well. Of her labs, all were negative besides her BNP, which was elevated to 4,000. And her chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, and a normal cardiac silhouette. Her echo showed restricted cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with non sustained left ventricular tachycardia. That's what I saw afterwards after talking to the patient. New York Heart Association class 2 because she did not report having difficulty with activities besides, exercise. And and so this is secondary to her hypertension and her pulmonary sarcoidosis. So a patient was admitted to telemetry, with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, rid restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to sarcoidosis. It is she's a serious condition. She will be getting vitals q 2 hours and out of bed with assistance. And nursing instructions include strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and o two v and nasal cannula to make sure that it's at least 96%. I recommended a low sodium diet so that we can get some of the fluid off. We included, keeping vein open for fluids. Her we will continue the Lisinopril, but we will also add on, please, furosemide 40 milligrams IV and, increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams. And we'll be administering amiodarone a 150 milligrams via IV, because of the ventricular tachycardia. And we will also be ordering a CMP panel for labs and so we can further monitor the sarcoidosis. And we'll be consulting interventional cardiology for defibrillator AICD placement, and we'll be consulting radiology to get a, a PET scan to further show the sarcoidosis."
"This is Palmer who is a 62 year old female with a history of pulmonary sarcoid and hypertension. She comes to the ED today with episodes of shortness of breath, near syncope, as well as fatigue and palpitations and orthopnea. She says that this has been going on for about 2 months and worsening since onset. She saw her primary care physician for her symptoms about 3 days ago and had had some tests done. She's unsure of what tests were done, and she hasn't gotten those results back yet. She called them today due to exacerbation of her symptoms and was referred to the ER. She says that her her symptoms are exacerbated with most of her activity. She notes that she was previously very active walking about 5 times a week, but now is unable to do that due to her symptoms. She also notes orthopnea, noting that she is now sleeping in the recliner due to shortness of breath when lying flat. She denies any loss of consciousness. She denies, chest pain. She does endorse an 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks as well as some lower extremity swelling. She also endorses some subjective wheezing. Her history, as I said, she has a pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she is on chronic prednisone 10 milligrams. She also has hypertension for which she's on Lisinopril 10 milligrams a day. She had a clean cardiac cath about a year ago after an abnormal EKG or PCP. She denies tobacco use, alcohol, illicit drug use. She lives at home with her husband who she says is supportive. She does have insurance for her job as a 4th grade teacher. Vitals were significant for slight tachycardia at a 110 with slight hypertension at 136 over 99. Her SpO 2 was slightly hypoxic at 91%. She was 8 febrile. Physical exam was significant for a systolic murmur, with an s four gallop. She did have positive JVD, but no carotid breweries. She had bibasilar, rales, and wheeze in her lungs in both lungs. She did have 1 plus pedal edema with no cap tenderness and negative Hohman sign. Labs were remarkable for an elevated troponin of 4,000 or or elevated BNP of 4,000. I'm sorry. And a negative troponin. Chest x ratio of mediastinal fullness, consistent with pulmonary sarcoid. She had no cardiomegaly and no pulmonary edema. EKG did show a sinus tachycardia at a rate of about a100. She had a normal access. She did have a run of non sustained, b tach on the EKG, but her rhythm in the room was a normal sinus. Echo did show restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness. EF was normal at 55%. I believe that her symptoms are due to, sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with an NYHA scale of 3. For her, I would like to admit her to telemetry and give her amiodarone for the non sustained V TAC, keep her on her bisinopril, and increase her prednisone dose to 60 milligrams, a day, PO. I also would like to give 40 milligrams of furosemide IV, for fluid overload. As far as labs, I would like to order a CMP to keep an eye on her potassium because we're giving that furosemide. I don't believe she needs any, diagnostic imaging orders at this time, but I do want to consult radiology for a possible, FDG PET scan to look at the, infiltrates in her heart. I would also like to consult interventional cardiology for an a for a possible AICD placement given the NSVT."
"Mister Leslie presented to the clinic today. He's a 60 year old 60 2 year old male. I'm gonna restart. 62 year old male, mister Leslie, presented to the clinic today, 3 days after, something concerning came up with his from his family medicine doctor. He was, he has a fairly extensive past metabolic history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. He is a type 1 diabetic and smoked, for 30 a pack a day for 30 years, but he, more concerning right now is is his elevated blood work. His troponin atroponins, he has, severe orthopnea and and very, very, extensive undue dyspnea on exertion. So, even having dyspnea at rest. But, he has a history of AFib. He's had, he's had an open heart surgery. He's had a CABG he's had a CABG coronary artery bypass graft. He's had a cardiac stent for the one one a year for the last 5 years. Not his parents didn't necessarily have any sort of, similar issues. He would like I mentioned, he was a he was a smoker. For his stance on blood, he's on, clopidogrel, metoprolol. He's on furosemide, Lisinopril, warfarin metformin. He doesn't have any allergies. He has he's had 8 £8 of edema in his lower extremities that he noted, on during the review of systems. There's, very few pertinent negatives on our, thing except he has not experienced any chest pain or discomfort. No palpitations. So he says he has, some sort of, on and off afib, paroxysmal afib, atrial fibrillation. And walking in, notices blood pressure to be 80 over 50. Heart rate of 90. Respirate respiration is a little bit elevated. A bit a bit if you will. And very low to SADS SVO 2 around 86%. Did have general obedience suspension on physical exam. No murmur. Friction, rub, gallop. His PMI was displaced bilaterally, and then, sure enough, he had a, cardiomegaly on on, chest x-ray. Rail, sure enough, were present. Did in in in fact have pedal edema. Normal pulses and extremities. He he does have an ejection fraction, of less than 30% on on 2 d echo, PLAX view. BNP was elevated. Trampon was elevated. Also, classified here as a New York Heart Association. New York Heart Association class 4 heart failure, likely now going the direction of adding dobutamine on top of the the not working, Inovascally, very dry, nearly as a potato chip. And he he cannot take any more diuretics, so we're gonna add dobutamine. So I'd like to add dobutamine. Definitely gonna admit him to the ICU as a critical patient. Monitor him every 2 hours. Screw thighs and nose. DBD prophylaxis. Have him take good care of him. Do a KVO. No standing fluids because he's in pretty bad severe heart failure. Isn't having any pain. But, I'll keep a thinner going. I would like to keep a thinner going. Thinners going. Do not not adding any sort of diuretics. I put them on an insulin sliding scale instead of his metformin. Of course, monitoring PTINR. And then I'm gonna have interventional cardiology take a look at them. Though they had, they said no more stenting or or CABG bypasses. But but it is likely that I would recommend maybe a because of a left bundle branch block and a left axis on the axis on EKG, I recommend a cardio resynchronization therapy device as well as, an automated internal cardiac defibrillator, if if noted, if deemed so by the interventional cardiologist. That is all I have. We will keep an eye on him. Watch him very closely. We'll send him up to ICU now, if that is okay. Alright. Studio Doctor. Tate out."
"She's a 62 year old female who presented to the emergency department due to extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. She did include that about 2 weeks ago, she was sick with a fever, cough, runny nose, and she thought she just had a cold. She was able to continue to exercise through this time, but it was just causing some fatigue and shortness of breath. She said about 5 days ago, her symptoms resolved and she thought she was getting better, but then she went to her primary care doctor 3 days ago because she was still having really bad fatigue when she was trying to do activities. The fatigue and shortness of breath does not occur at rest. I took a history of the patient. She does have a medical history of hypertension. And surgical wise, she had a cardiac catheter done, but she said there were no significant findings with that. She does take one medication, which is Lisinopril 10 milligrams. As far as family history, her mom passed away from breast cancer about 5 years ago, and her dad is currently in a home. He has Alzheimer's or dementia, but he's still living. As far as her social history, she does not use any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She works as an elementary school teacher. She said her diet is good and balanced. Her caffeine usage is moderate. She says about a cup a day. As far as exercise, she does remain active. She likes to go to the gym about 3 times a week, but has been unable to since her cardiac symptoms, shortness of breath, and fatigue started. And as far as living situation, she is married and stated she feels supported and comfortable at home. She has no known drug allergies. As far as her ROS, she did have fatigue and a recent weight gain she stated of about £8. There were no skin issues, no headache or neck stiffness. She did feel chest palpitations and she was also positive for wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, meaning she was more out of breath while she was lying down. She also did notice some lower extremity edema. As far as her appearance, she was awake and oriented. She was just extremely fatigued. Her vital signs, her temperature was 98.6, so no fever. Blood pressure was 130 over 90. Oxygen was 91. Heart rate, 110, and respiratory rate was 20. For physical exam, I didn't hear, no carotid Bruy was present, but she did have GVD. As far as her heart, she had a regular rate. No murmur, friction rub, or gallop were heard, but her PMI was displaced laterally. Wheezes and reels were also present, but she had no chest wall tenderness. She had no calf tenderness. Her lower extremity pulses were full and equal, and she did have plus 1 pitting edema. As far as her chest x-ray, this indicated cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary edema, which I explained to the patient. And her echo was indicative of a dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. Her EKG came back as sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block. In her labs, her troponin was elevated and her BNP level was 4,000. Now, knowing all of this, plus her history and her diagnostics, I did make the diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. She was at a NYHA classification of 2 because she was still able to do some activity and her symptoms did get better at rest, but they also were triggered when she was exercising. Therefore, I told the patient that we did are gonna need to admit her specifically to telemetry. Her condition was serious. She's gonna be getting vitals every 2 hours. Activity is as stop tolerated. As far as nursing interventions, she needs strict stat strict INOs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, maintaining her o two stat above 96%, and she's also gonna get an o two nasal cannula. Diet wise, she should be low sodium. IV fluids should be KVO, so just keeping that vein open. And then as far as medications, I instructed the patient we are gonna be giving her a pain med. So that's acetaminophen 6 25 milligrams by mouth. She can stay on her Lisinopril, which is 10 milligrams by mouth daily. That's what she's already taking, and she will continue to. And then we're also adding furosemide 40 milligrams by IV. She needs no type of diabetic intervention, no BiPAP. And for labs, I'm ordering serial troponins as well as a CMP. And she's going to be met by an interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist. And they are gonna consult about an AICD placement, a CRTD placement, could doing a media enhanced MRI, as well as a myocardial or endomyocardial biopsy. The patient was instructed of all of this, that she would be admitted, doing additional labs and testing, that we were going to keep her on some medicine, as well as add a pain killer and a medicine that was going to improve her cardiac function, and patient was agreeable to the plan. She stated she has a good support system at home, as well as insurance, and she was comfortable moving forward with this."
"Alright. So the patient today was a 62 year old female named Leslie. She presented to the office with complaints of dyspnea and with dyspnea and fatigue. She, stated that she was sick with a viral illness 2 weeks ago with, fever, cough, chills, all of that sort of stuff. She started feeling better, but then she started having, the shortness of breath symptoms Got it. And exercise intolerance. She said that she has trouble breathing when she's lying down, and she's had to be she's had to sleep in her recliner, because she can't breathe. So she also has orthopnea. She would be considered an NYHA class 2 because she has slight, restriction in her activity. She described her diet as balanced. She denied, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol use, 1 cup a day of coffee. She was working out 2 times a week at the gym, but then she had to stop due to her symptoms. She's an elementary school teacher, and she teaches the 3rd grade, and she's married. She has a past medical history of hypertension, for which she's taking 10 milligrams of Lisinopril daily. She has no known drug allergies. She had a cardiac catheterization, about a year ago, and the results of that were normal. Her mother passed away from breast cancer, and her dad is 89 with dementia, and he's in a nursing home right now. She talks about how she's gained £8. She was having trouble breathing. She's wheezing. She felt like she's having heart palpitations, as well as chest pain. Her vital signs, her temp was good, blood pressure was a bit high at 130 over 90. Her o two sat was a bit low at 91, and her heart rate was a bit high at 110, beats per minute. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly as well as, a pulmonary infiltrate with a pulmonary edema. Her troponin levels were raised at point 1 and BNP levels were raised at 4,000. Her EKG showed tachycardia, a left axis deviation, and a right bundle branch block. Her echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. All of this led me to believe that she had myocarditis, due to that viral infection, with dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. I told her that we needed to admit her to telemetry, that we were going to add 625 grams of acetaminophen for pain control as well as 48 milligrams of ferrostomy to get, rid of some of the fluid. I'd like to repeat the troponins, and then also repeat the CMP since we started that furosemide. I'd like to consult with the radiologist to get a contrast MRI to see where the inflammation is in her heart. I'd also like to consult, intermediate cardio interventional cardiology, to talk about placing a CRTD or an AICD. I'd also like to get a repeat on the two d echo. And then I'd also like to consult infectious disease to see if we can figure out, the cause of the virus that causes myocarditis. That is all."
"Hello. Today, we have 62 year old miss Palmer presenting to the ER with chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She says she had flu like symptoms 2 weeks ago, which included cough, runny nose, as well as a fever. These symptoms cleared up and then were followed by shortness of breath, fatigue and a chest ache 5 days ago. She went to her PCP the same day who told her to wait and see how the symptoms progressed. Today, the symptoms became worse, so she came here to the ER. The patient reports that some exercise makes her chest ache worse, putting her in line with a New York Heart Association class of 2. In contrast, sitting up makes the shortness of breath better, which is why the patient has been sleeping in a chair at night. She rates the pain as a 2 out of 10 and describes it as being dull in her chest and says that there is no radiation of the chest pain. The patient underwent a cardiac cath 1 a year ago after she had an abnormal EKG, which found nothing out of the ordinary. She has a history of hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril. Her positive review of symptom, review of cyst systems symptoms include fatigue, 8 pound weight gain over the last 2 weeks, achy and swollen lower legs, chest pain and palpitations, as well as some orthopnea. Her vitals are as follows 130 over 90 blood pressure, 110 heart rate, 20 respiration rates, 98.6 temperature and 91 percent O2 on room air. Physical exam was positive for JVD bilaterally, wheezing and rales bilaterally on auscultation, pedal edema, as well as a laterally displaced PMI. Her lab showed increased BNP and troponin. The car the chest x-ray indicated cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary edema. And her echo showed, dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Based on the symptoms and workup, I believe she has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I suggest we admit her to telemetry, continue her Lisinopril while adding acetaminophen and lasix, and have interventional cardiology, infectious diseases, and radiology follow-up put on her. Additionally, I would like to administer IV fluids, a diet low in sodium, daily weight checks, DVT prophylaxis, oxygen by nasal cannula maintaining oxygen stats over 96% and activity as tolerated. We will perform serial troponins and the CMP as well as a repeat 2 d echo to aid in care. Thank you."
"Case of Leslie Palmer. He is a 69 year old male that's presenting to the ER with a history of shortness of breath, fatigue, and have some heart palpitations upon physical exercise. He states that he used to walk regularly with his friends, but is having trouble doing that due to shortness of breath. He also states he has been wheezing. He has been diagnosed with hypertension, which he takes Lisinopril for. His he has no known drug allergies. His current vitals are heart rate of 110, oxygen of 96. His BP was 130 over 90, and his temperature was 98 0.6. For his social history, he states he eats a well balanced diet diet. He exercises regularly. He drinks a cup of coffee a day and denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He is currently retired and sexually active in a monogamous relationship. His family history did reveal that his mother died suddenly of an unknown cause at 40, and his father died of an MI 59. Upon physical examination, he did reveal that he had positive JVD, a PMI that was displaced laterally, and you could hear wheezing and rales bilaterally upon auscultation. He also presented with lower extremity edema. His x-ray results showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy. His left atrium was enlarged, and there was some hyperkinesia with an LVEF of 60%. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with tall r waves in the septal leads. In summary, Leslie Palmer presents for shortness of breath, heart palpitations, cardiomegaly, which point to a familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And his n I NYHA scale was about a 2 because, with some physical exercise would produce the symptoms. His condition is considered serious. He will have his vitals monitored every 2 hours. Activity as is tolerated, and nursing instructions are strict in and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, o two via nasal cannula, maintain o two stats above 96%, his diet is normal, and IV fluids are saline lock. Its medications, we will discontinue Lisinopril and initiate desopyrimidine. The we will also consult interventional cardiology for AICD placement as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible future septal myectomy or alcohol injection to reduce LVOT. Thank you. Bye."
"So mister Palmer is a 62 year old male who presents to the ER today, complaining of shortness of breath that started 2 weeks ago while he was walking with some friends after work. He says while he was walking, it just kind of hit him suddenly, and he got really short of breath. He felt really fatigued, and he felt like his heart was racing. He said after he rested, all his symptoms went away. But since then, every single time that he's, done any bit of, like, light exercise, like moving around and walking like he did. He starts to get that shortness of breath. He says he also will intermittently get the palpitations. Because of this, he went and saw his family medicine physician 3 days ago, and, they did some labs and imaging. And then I guess they got the results today. And he said that he was called by them today and told to come to the ER so that we could evaluate him. He doesn't have any other complaints. He hasn't noticed any leg swelling. He hasn't noticed any, like, recent fever, chills, cough, no recent rash. He hasn't been sweating with any of these events. Well, he said his initial complaint has been the only thing that's bothered him. He says something like this has never happened before. He doesn't complain of any chest pain right now. But about a year ago, he says that he did, have a heart cath after he had, an abnormal EKG on, like, a routine physical. He said that, his heart cath showed, he had no blockages. So, he hasn't had any issues with that since then until this event. He has a history of high blood pressure. He takes Lisinopril Lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day for that. He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, hasn't used any illicit drugs like cocaine ever in the past. He's an elementary school teacher. He has a regular diet, and he says that he regularly exercises. And every day after work, he'll go on a walk with his friends. But he hasn't been able to do that in the last 2 weeks because of his symptoms. His family history is significant. His father died of a heart attack at the age of 59. His mother died unexpectedly, at the age of 40. He says he doesn't know why. On physical, his he's tachycardic, heart rate of 110. He was hypertensive with, blood pressure of 130 over 90. He says he has been taking his meds and he hasn't missed any doses. He also says he doesn't have any medication allergies. His o two sat was 96 on room air. He's awake, alert, sitting comfortably. While I talked to him, he was able to lay down without any shortness of breath while I did his physical. He didn't have any JVD or a brusi, carotid artery, or abdominal, brusi, or palpable aneurysm that I could feel. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He, had a regular rhythm on, while auscultating his heart. He did have an s form murmur, systolic. No rubs, but he did have the gallop. He didn't have any chest wall tenderness. He didn't have any edema. He had good, strong DP and PT pulses. His calves are equal in size, and home inside was negative. We're reviewing his labs from the doctor's office, sitting at his opponent and being pee on him. Both were normal. His EKG had some LBH, but it was normal rhythm and rate. On his chest x-ray, he had cardiomegaly, but his lungs were clear bilaterally. His airways were intact, trachea midline. He didn't have any fractures. The only thing significant was cardiomegaly. His echo, he had, enlarged intervertic reticular interventricular septum, which I assume is why they sent him over. So, I told him we would admit him, put him on some oxygen just to get that up a little bit since his, o two set is, like, 96, that could be better. And then we would have the interventional cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon follow-up with him while he's in hospital. And we would start him on the DIPEREA being instead of, him taking the Lisinopril. And then he's on exercise restrictions until he's cleared by another physician. And he was agreeable to be admitted to telemetry."
"Hi there. I'd like to do a case presentation today, on miss Palmer. 62 year old female, came in today complaining of, chest pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. Patient states that a week ago, she had been dealing with flu like symptoms, specifically cold, fever, and those had subsided. However, her fatigue has persisted since then. Patient has a past medical history of hypertension. She treats that with Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. Patient has a past surgical history of a cardiac catheter a year ago, was performed or performed for having an abnormal EKG. Family history, mother has a history of breast cancer, passed away, No pertinent medical history from father. In terms of review of systems, patient, has gained £8 in the last week, stated. Additionally, patient has palpitations that have been coinciding with her chest pain recently, she stated. Patients also notice, severe orthopnea as well, when lying down and is not sleeping in a recliner. Has has also wheezing and coughing. And in terms of muscle pain, patient states that she has, bilateral radiating muscle pain in her lower extremities as well. On physical exam, I noticed that patient's blood pressure was elevated, at 1 30 over 90. Patient was also tachycardic at a heart rate of a 110 beats per minute. Upon auscultation, I noticed the patient had bilateral rails in her lungs. Additionally, patient, had bilateral jugular venous distension as well, and she had bilateral kitting edema, in her lower extremities. And in regards to, my plan moving forward, I think, miss Palmer should be admitted to the hospital. Likely, diagnosis being, myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I think, moving forward, we should be consulting cardiology for treatment of potential arrhythmia, consulting infectious disease to try and control potential inflammation, from infection, and as well as, radiology for, considering an MRI to have a more in-depth, look at the extent of damage to the heart. In terms of medications to be using, continue Lisinopril, for the patient to decrease blood pressure and also consider adding furosemide as well, to try and remove excess fluid from the patient. And additionally, using acetaminophen currently to, decrease inflammation, and limit any further cardiac damage. That's all I have for you. Thank you so much."
"Presenting the patient that I saw who was Leslie Palmer, a 62 year old male presenting with chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that the symptoms started a few weeks ago when he was with his friends. He started feeling light headed and like he was going to pass out. Patient is comfortable at rest but has symptom onset, when he performs physical activity, such as going for longer walks. He also notes heart palpitations and rasping. ROS was positive for fatigue, light headedness, presyncope, palpitations, wheezing, and dyspnea on exertion. Past medical history was significant for hypertension. Past surgical history was significant for a heart cath 1 year ago that turned up normal. Past family history, his mom passed away or died when she was 40 years old due to an unknown cause. It was a sudden death. His father passed away when or died when he was 69 from a myocardial infarction. For social history, he does patient does not drink, does not smoke, and does not use illicit drugs. He consumes a balanced diet and moderate caffeine. He exercises 3 to 3 to 5 times per week until the last few weeks. He has not been exercising due to his symptoms. He is a teacher, and he lives with his husband. For medications, he takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily for his hypertension. He has no known drug allergies. His vital signs were normal except for an elevated heart rate of 110. Physical exam was positive for jugular venous distension, bibasilar rails and wheezing, PMI displaced laterally, and 1 plus pinning edema in the lower extremities. Otherwise, the physical exam was normal. His chest x rays showed cardiomegaly. His labs were normal including troponin and BNP. His echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement with left ventricular hyperkinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria with tall r waves in the septal leads. Based on these results and the patient's past medical history and his presenting symptoms, I believe that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I recommend that we admit him to telemetry. His condition is serious. He I recommend that we take his vitals every 2 hours. He can do activity as tolerated. Nursing interventions include strict ins and outs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations over 96 96%. His diet can be regular. IV fluids keep pain open. Medications, I recommend we discontinue Lisinopril and instead start disopiramide 100 milligrams 4 times daily. I recommend we consult with interventional cardiology to discuss AICD placement. I also recommend we we consult with cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss possible septomyomectomy and alcohol injection. Thank you."
"I'm presenting to you Leslie Palmer, who is 62 year old female who came into the hospital after her primary care doctor advised her to do so. She presented with the complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations, which occurred as a result of physical activity, like walking or even getting up. When she moves at all, her symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath start to occur. And then a couple of minutes later, with some rest, they'll go away. She'll occasionally wake up struggling to breathe, and occasionally she'll have shortness of breath if she's laying down flat. But if she sits up, she gets better. She has a past surgical history of getting a heart cath a couple years ago, but she's never been hospitalized. She takes Lisinopril 10 milligram and prednisone 10 milligram currently, and she has no allergies. Her past medical history includes high blood pressure and sarcoidosis. Her medical issues have been handled relatively well until her new issues arise. Her father passed away of some unexplained death a few years ago, and her mother had a heart attack at 59. She doesn't smoke, used tobacco, or illicit drugs. Currently, she's a elementary school teacher who has been able to continue working, and eat a healthy balanced diet. She used to walk daily, but recently she hasn't been able to walk as often due to her issues. My review of systems found that she had gained £8 in the past week, and had swelling in her legs. She also had the issues of dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, and palpitations. The remaining review of symptoms were negative. I performed the physical exam and found wheezing and lower extremity edema. Her lab test showed an elevated BNP. Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with mediastinal fullness, but no altered cardiac silhouette. An echocardiogram showed restricted cardiomyopathy with an enlarged wall and a slightly decreased ejection fraction. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia. After her appointment, I would like to diagnose her with Sarcoidosis Restricted Cardiomyopathy, NYHA class 3, and Secondary Hypertension, and Secondary Pulmonary Sarcoidosis. I ordered her to be admitted to telemetry with vitals every 2 hours, out of bed with assistance, strict IO, daily weight, and nasal cannula to maintain an o two saturation of 96%. She also will get daily weight, a low sodium diet, saline LOCK KVO for fluids. She'll continue taking Lisinopril Lisinopril 10 milligram, and I will increase her prednisone dosage to 60 milligrams. And then I'll add amiodarone 150 milligrams, anthrocentide 40 milligrams via IV. She'll get a repeat CMP to check for differences, and she'll see a interventional cardiologist to consider putting in an AICD. She will also see a nuclear medicine radiologist to get an f e FDG PET scan to, look for further issues."
"Case presentation on a new patient, mister Palmer. He's a 62 year old male presenting with the chief complaint of dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue that started 6 months ago. It has not worsened in past due dates. The patient went to their family family medicine doctor. They ran a couple of tests, and the family medicine referred him to the e d the emergency department. He has a history of hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, and AFib, which he takes Lisinopril, metoprolol, succinate, metformin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and warfarin 4. He has no known drug allergies. He has gained a couple of pounds in the past 2 weeks and also has bouts of palpitations. He also mentioned swelling in his ankle. He has a surgical history of a triple coronary artery bypass and 5 coronary stents put in. Regarding his social history, he has a history of tobacco use, smoking 1 pack per day for the last 30 years. He also drinks 1 cup of coffee a day. He currently lives with his wife and is generally active and walks regularly, but he has not been able to do so recently. Regarding his family, his mother is deceased and passed away from breast cancer at 80, and his father is currently in a facility for Alzheimer's. Now in regards to his vitals, temperature was 90 98.6, heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22, and blood pressure was 80 over 50, and oxygen sat was 86%. Cardiopulmonary and physical exam showed positive JVD, tachycardia, gallop, rails, and wheezing all as present. The patient showed no signs of carotid or abdominal brew abdominal brulee. He had pedal edema and dorsalospetus and posterior tibialis. Pulses were full bilateral. They were equal. His lab showed elevated troponin and BNP at 4,000. X-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. ECHO showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at 30%. And the patient claimed that, prior imaging showed that he had a ejection fraction of 40%, so now it is lower. An EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis, and left bundle branch block. Hohman's sign testing for DVT was negative. At this point, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was suspected. So I spoke to him about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about his social support and insurance. At this time, he will be admitted to the e ICU. Vitals will be taken every 2 hours, and activity are activity instructions are strict bed rest. Nursing interventions include strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and BiPAP 16 number 6 FIO 2 at 50% for respiratory therapy. Diet is low sodium and KBO lock. Medication will include clopidogrel 75 milligrams, 4 times a day, warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, 2 times a day, and dobutamine IV drip. The patient will also receive an insulin sliding scale for their diabetes. Seriotroponin and PTIN arm will also be ordered. He will be consulted by an interventional cardiologist for possible AICD and CRTD placement. The patient claimed they had transportation at the hospital."
"Alright. So, patient named Leslie Palmer presents, complaining of an onset of fatigue, dyspnea, as well as orthopnea that's been present, even at rest. And it's been getting even worse for the past 6 months. After this, a review system was taken, and the general view of systems noted fatigue as well as a weight gain of about £8. Musculoskeletal review system, and it indicated lower extremity edema, and the EEMNT was, was negative for anything. Pulmonary test, indicated dyspnea as well as orthopnea. Neuro test was negative. Skin test was negative as well as cardio test was also negative. After this, a surgical history was taken in which the patient noted was noted to have have previously had a triple bypass cardiac surgery as well as a stent placement. The medications that the patient was on was, Lisinopril 10 milligrams, metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams, atorvastatin 10 milligrams, metformin 500 milligrams, furosemide 20 milligrams, and clopidogrel 75 milligrams. There was no no noted allergies. As for the social history, the patient, the patient noted that, his food intake was very balanced. His exercise routine, the patient, noted that, he used to go he used to like to, to walk. However, now that the Disneyland orthopnea, has gotten even worse, it's too difficult to do these activities. So he does not exercise. As for drugs, there's no drug drug use or list of drug use. There's no other, the patient has been smoking tobacco for the last 30 years or has been smoking for the last 30 years. The patient has no alcohol intake. However, as for caffeine, the patient, does drink one cup of coffee a day and is also as for the occupation, the patient is a school teacher and the patient is sexually active. As for past, past hospitalizations, the patient, had a hospitalization for the triple bypass surgery as well as stenting. As for the family history, the mother was, was noted to have, died from breast cancer, and the father, the father is in a nursing home, with Alzheimer's disease. As for the past medical history for the patient, this includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, as well as atrial fibrillation. The vital signs were also noted. The blood pressure was 80 over 50, which was told to the patient as being a little, too low. Pulse was 90, which which is good. Respiratory rate was 22, which is noted to the patient as being too high. The temperature was, noted as 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which was noted as being normal. And, o two saturations, was noted to be 86, 86%, which was noted to the patient as being abnormal and too low. Going to the physical examination, both pulses radial pulses were present. However, the pedial pulse, the pedial pulse and posterior tubulars pulse was not taken. There was a positive JVD. Bibasilar rails, were also noted on lung auscultation. There was also pitting edema that was noted. After after the fiscal examination, the labs were the labs were, were examined and discussed with the patient. This included CPC and CMP, which were both normal. Over troponin was elevated, which was, told to the patient as being a sign of potential cardiac damage. BNP was also elevated, which was told to the patient as being a sign of possible, cardiac heart failure. And chest x rays showed signs of a pulmonary edema as well as cardiomegaly. EKG also shows, showed a left left bundle branch block as well as a left axis deviation, and a normal sinus rhythm. Also, a nonentrant v reentrant non reentrant ventricular tachycardia was noted to the patient. However, that was incorrect. After this, a diagnosis, a diagnosis was made of a type of New York scale type 4 ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which was told to the patient. And with this, the patient was told that he is going to be admitted into the ICU and that there's gonna be a medication change. The medication change includes, changing, holding off on all of the medications except for clopidogrel, as well as, clopidogrel, as well as warfarin, and adding dobutamine, to increase the heart increase heart contractions and heart rate, to fight off possible cardiogenic shock, as well as, adding a, insulin sliding scale for the diabetes. Also, it was told to the patient that, interventional cardiology would be, would be consulted with for a possible AICD and CRPD, placement. CRPD would know was not noticed to the patient. However, AICD was noticed to the patient. After this, this, the labs that need to be taken were not noted to the patient or the labs that do need to be taken are serial troponin as well as IVINR, are 2 labs, that need to be taken, after this. Yeah. I think that's it. Alright. Thank you so much. Also, with that, this was not noted to the patient, but the patient needs to be put on a BiPAP. BiPAP, 50%, 50%, FIO 2 and 16 by 60 for the BiPAP for oxygen saturation."
"To you today. So I had just finished seeing missus Palmer. She's a 62 year old woman who presents state emergency department today with complaints of cough, shortness excuse me. With complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. She claims that a couple of a few days ago, she had a viral infection for which she had cough, she had fever, and just general malaise. She saw her primary care physician for which she says that the symptoms resolved except for her shortness of breath and fatigue. And currently, she's experiencing chest pain. As of now, she does not have a fever, but she does have shortness of breath and fatigue. When I asked her what aggravates, the shortness of breath, she says that any daily activities like walking around really makes her feel the shortness of breath and fatigue, but sitting in a reclined seat, so, like, sitting in her recliner, alleviates her symptoms. She also describes the chest pain as just dull chest pain. When I asked her about her past medical history, she told me that she has a history of hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams a day. She does not have any known allergies, neither to any food or medication. When I asked her for past hospitalization, she claims that she had a catheter, cardiac catheter catheterization placed 1 year ago. Her family history, her mother passed away with breast cancer and her father's currently, in an assisted living facility dealing with Alzheimer's. When I asked her about her social history, specifically her diet, she claims that she has a low balanced diet, that she eats a lot of meats, vegetables, fruits and vegetables. She also claims, for her caffeine intake that she only takes 1 cup of coffee, no alcohol, no tobacco use, and she does not take illicit drugs. Exercise wise, she used to be able to go to the gym twice a week, but now with her shortness of breath, she's not able to do that. And her living situation is that she lives currently with her husband, and she is a school teacher for her occupation. Now when going through, the review systems, for general general review system, everything was negative except for, an 8 pound weight gain within the last 2 weeks. All skin, review systems were negative. All HINTS review systems were negative. Neuro, everything was negative. Pulmonary, the only positive findings were positive wheezing, cough, dyspnea, and ortho orthopnea. For cardiac, the only thing that she claims positive was palpitation and chest pain. And for MSK, the only thing that she claimed, that she reported was swelling of her legs and muscle aches. All else were negative. So for her physical exam, her vitals, her heart rate was 110, which was a little bit elevated. Her blood pressure was 130 over 90 as well elevated and elevated. And, excuse me, her temperature was 98.6, and o two saturation was 91%. Physical exam findings, she had a positive GVD. She had bibasilar wheezing, edema in her leg, and her PMI was displaced laterally. When I looked at her lab, she had elevated troponin and BNP. Her chest X-ray did show edema and cardiomegaly, and her EKG showed premature ventricular contractions, left, excuse me, left atrial deviation, right bundle branch block, and sinus tachycardia. So I reviewed the labs with the patient. I reviewed the chest x-ray with the patient. I reviewed her EKG as well as her echo and her echo digital dilated left ventricular wall dilation with decreased effusion rate, which is around 30%. So I explained all her labs to her. I went over the lab, chest x-ray, EKG, and then we went with the plan. And so I told her considering that she did have a viral infection in the past few days and all her signs pointed to dilated cardiomyopathy, I do believe this is myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy. So her symptoms were due to her previous viral infection. So due to that, I'm going to place her furosemide to be able to get rid of the edema she has in her legs and in, her lungs. I also wanna continue her listen to proof of her blood pressure. I'm gonna give her acetaminophen for her chest pain. Labs wise, I'm gonna repeat troponin to be able to see, if it improves, and we're gonna repeat an ETG excuse me, repeat an echo. I also recommended that we add a cardiologist, an intervention interventional cardiologist to the team to be able to see if she's a candidate for, a defibrillator and add a radiologist to the team and infectious disease specialist. So with all that, I do believe the patient does have, hopeful outcomes, and I explained all this to her. She said that she had she was on board with the plan. She had social support at home, and that she did have insurance to be able to cover the cost of all this. I also told her that we would be admitting her to the telemetry floor and not the ICU. So admit to the telemetry floor. And then I also, lastly, explained to her that myocarditis was probably due to the viral infection shift before. The patient stated that she understood everything. She did not have any questions at the moment and agreed with her plan. And that was my encounter for today with the lovely missus Palmer, and I hope for the best. Thank you so much."
"Just finished meeting with Leslie Palmer. She's a 62 year old female who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. She mentioned this started 3 weeks ago when she had a cold. She said the chest pain was on her left side just above her left breast and rated it as dull, constant, and achy, and a 2 out of 10. She said it did not radiate anywhere, and for the shortness of breath, she said it was relieved by sitting up and bothered her more while lying down. She was awake, alert oriented, but I did note she was fatigued. Her vitals were a heart rate of 110, so slightly elevated, a respiratory rate of 20, oxygen stats at 91 percent, which I told her was low, and her respiratory rate slightly high, probably as a compensation for that. Her temperature was normal at 98.6 and her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 over 90. However, she does have a history of hypertension, so that may be normal for her. For her general review of systems, she had fatigue and a weight gain of 10 of £8. Everything else was negative. Her skin, heat, and neuro review of systems were all negative. For her cardio, she had chest pain and palpitations, but no near syncope. And for her pulmonary review of system, she had wheezing, dyspnea, and orthnea. And for her MSK, she had, lower extremity edema that she mentioned. So as I said, her past medical history is positive for hypertension for which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams orally every day. She has no surgical history or hospitalizations or no known drug allergies. Her mother passed away at 80 years old of breast cancer. Her father is currently 89 who is living in a care facility with Alzheimer's. For her personal social history, she eats a well balanced diet. She says she was exercising regularly up until the chest pain and shortness of breath, and so she is not currently exercising. She denies any drugs, tobacco, or alcohol use and drinks one cup of coffee per day. Her occupation is an elementary school teacher, and she lives with her husband who she's married to. I asked her about the, shortness of breath for which she said it occurs at rest. So that would be a grade 4 n y h scale. On physical exam, I noted that she was positive for jugular venous distension. She did not have any bruise. Her heart rate was regular with no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallops. Her PMI was displaced laterally. She did not have any chest wall tenderness, but on auscultation, she did have 5 basilar rails and wheezing. On her lower extremity exam, I noticed plus 1 pitting edema in the calves. Her calves were not tender, and her pulses were full and normal. Going over her lab work with her, I noted her troponins were high as well as her BNP was elevated at 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and her echo showed a dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. The EKG showed sinus tach, which was consistent with the monitor we had on her, and a right bundle branch block. So based on the physical exam history and lab work, I diagnosed myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So we are admitting her to the hospital with telemetry, serious condition, so we are gonna check vitals every 2 hours. Activity, I left as tolerated. For nursing interventions, strict input output, maintaining daily weight and DVT prophylaxis, and putting a nasal cannula on to maintain her oxygen sats above 96. For IV fluids, we're gonna, add furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to help with the pulmonary edema. And so I left IV fluid status as keep veins open. I prescribed 625 milligrams of oral acetaminophen for the pain and told her she could continue her 10 milligrams of Lisinopril daily for her cardiovascular system. Continue her 10 milligrams of Lisinopril daily for her cardiovascular system. No other respiratory therapy besides the nasal cannula. For lab orders, I ordered a CMP and serial troponins and a follow-up to the echo as well. And then consulted radiology, cardiology, and infectious disease so that we could get an AICD placed, a CRTD, and do a biopsy as well as getting her glucocorticoids and a media enhanced MRI. So she will be admitted into the hospital, and we should check-in with her frequently. But for now, that is all. Thank you very much."
"Palmer, who is a 62 year old woman presenting to the ED today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. She had a 2 week extent of runny nose, fever, and chest pain.

Activity is tolerated, strict in and out in strict ins and outs. 02, 2 liters per minute on the nasal cannula with maintenance above 96%, daily weight and DVT prophylaxis. She's to be put on a low sodium sodium diet, and an IV should be placed to keep the vein open. Medication should be given, with 625 milligrams of acetaminophen every 6 hours. She can continue her lisinopril on 10 milligrams per day, and also adding furosemide 40 milligrams over IV done every 12 hours. CMP and serials troponins as well as a two d echo should also be completed, and those should be reviewed at a later time once they are completed. Cardiology should be consulted for an AICD placement or a CRTD placement as well as an endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease should be consulted, for immune globulin or glucocorticoids, and radiology should be consulted for a media enhanced MRI."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting to the emergency room, today with a history of fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, and presyncope. She has she has a 2 month history of these symptoms. They're worse with activity. She's seen her primary care provider about it who has ordered several tests done, which she does not have the results of yet. Patient states that she has begun sleeping in her recliner due to significant orthopnea, and recently her symptoms have gotten much worse, prompting her to present to the emergency room. Review of systems, pertinent positives includes, an 8 pound weight gain under, general review systems.

"Male patient present to the emergency room, after the, at the request of his primary care physician. He had, fatigue and, was tired. These symptoms only, came about whenever he was well, they were pretty constant. They occurred when he was at rest. They occurred in any amount of exercise. If he stood up, he had symptoms. So dyspnea and orthopnea. He also presented with, petting edema. He his past medical history, was hypertension, high cholesterol, had diabetes, and he also had Afib. He had no drug allergies. His family, history was significant for, his dad, is 89 and currently has Alzheimer's. His mom, died at 80 of breast cancer. His surgical history is that 12 years ago, he ago, he had open heart surgery, for CABG, 3 vessels. But he has stent placed, each of the last 5 years, and the last one was for the left anterior descending artery, and his last echo showed an ejection fraction of 40 percent. His medications are he was on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams atorvastatin, clopidogrel. He was also on furosemide, methylsuccinate. He was also on metformin, and he also was on morphine. His review of systems, was significant for fatigue, and, also, he had a weight gain of £8. Like I said, he had dyspnea and orthopnea. He also presented with wheezing. His musculoskeletal exam, or his review systems, was significant for edema. He he did have a significant edema in his lower extremity. Also, he present he, claimed that he had a balanced diet.

Among other nurse among multiple nursing orders, he was going to be, put on bed rest, Vitals checked every 2 hours. We're gonna pick him up, for BiPAP. We're going to give him, also, I would like to say that, after reviewing the patient's, vitals, he had a, heart New York Heart, association score of, 4, because of his symptoms, even while at rest. The patient's lab results and and echo results and EKG results, showed that he had a ischemic, cardio, dilated cardiomyopathy. He, his ejection fraction was at 30%. His X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. He, did have normal sinus rhythm, but there was a left bundle branch branch block present. His troponin was elevated. His labs, only slight, troponin elevation, though, and that his lab his BNP was elevated at at 4,000. The patient was informed that he had ischemic cardio, dilated cardiomyopathy. The nurse was instructed, to include daily weight, strict food plan, diet plan, and also DVT DVT prophylaxis. Diet was limited to low sodium. IV fluids were KVO, to keep the veins open. No pain medicine was ordered, but the patient was kept on clopidogrel and warfarin and moved, to dobutamine and also, an insulin sliding scale is implemented. No diuretics were ordered. The diagnostic labs ordered were PT PTT INR, and serial troponins. The PTT INR, was in order to monitor, the where he is on blood thinners, and then, serial troponin was just to recheck the troponin levels to make sure, no was taking place or anything along those lines. Patient was referred to an interventional cardiologist, for AICD placement and CRTD placement. Other than that, patient was, seemed to be alert and, was not was not didn't seem to be in drastic pain, but did present with, with with prevalent symptoms. Just looking through the patient's, medical history again, to make sure that I didn't leave anything out. Patient did note that when they went to bed, that the symptoms did get much worse. They had no illicit drug use, alcohol use. The review of systems was negative for HEINT and cardio, neuro, and skin. No allergies were present. There was a, the patient did present with carotid breweries. Excuse me. No carotid breweries, but, jugular venous distention was was noticed. There, was also tachycardia with a split s 2, and the PMI was displaced laterally. The lungs did show bibasilar rails. There was plus 1 1 plus pitting edema in the lower extremities. Pulses were intact. Yeah. And the patient did have normal sinus rhythm on the EKG. Thank you."
"A 62 year old white male, mister Leslie Peterson, presented to clinic today with chief complaint of dyspnea and fatigue. The patient notes dyspnea and fatigue for 6 months with exacerbation within the last few weeks. The patient visited primary care physician and, upon preliminary review, was recommended to visit emergency department. The patient has a long history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting as well as stenting in the LAD, and the patient notes that they were indicated they are no longer a candidate for stenting. The patient's past medical history or past medic current medication list includes metoprololacicinate, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, warfarin, and atorvastatin. The patient was active prior to exacerbation of symptoms but is no longer able to exercise nor continue with activities of daily living. The patient presents with fatigue, generalized fatigue, exercise, and resting, dyspnea, orthopnea. The patient was unable to indicate a localization of the fatigue or the pain, or muscle weakness. There is not a time constraint on symptoms as they occur throughout the day. Upon physical exam, I noted plus 1 bilateral pinionedema on the lower extremity as well as rails and wheezing with an s 3 heart sound. The patient's vitals were 90 heart rate of 90, o 2 of 86, and blood pressure of 80 over 50. The patient was counseled as they present a concern. The patient is used to seeing hypertensive values. The patient does indicate weight gain of £8 over the last few weeks. Upon review of labs, and labs indicate elevated troponin as well as elevated BNP brain natriuretic peptide. Reviewing imaging, chest X-ray is positive for pulmonary edema as well as cardiomegaly. Echo indicates left ventricular and left atrial dilation with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%. EKG indicates left access left access deviation with a left bundle branch block as well as pathological deep q waves and septal leads 2 and 3. The patient was counseled that they will be admitted. The patient was counseled that they are experiencing ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and will be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient was indicated to discontinue all medications except for clopidogrel and warfarin and was also known that due to EKG changes and conduction due to dilation, the patient will be started on dobutamine for conduct for inotrophy and, to assist with hypovolemia. The patient will be admitted to ICU with follow-up serotroponins received. The interventional cardiology will be consulted for AICD and CR TD placement, and the patient was aware of is aware of this. The patient is on bed rest with nursing orders placed."
"Palmer is a 6262 year old female presenting in the ER today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She states that this has been going on for 6 months now, and it has gradually gotten worse. She went and saw her family doctor with symptoms 3 days ago, and they referred her here. She states shortness of breath with all activity and at rest. She sleeps in the chair sitting up at night because of orthopnea. She currently has diagnoses of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and Afib. Surgical history consists of a triple bypass graft procedure and an LAD stent placed 1 year ago in June 2022. Current medications include Lisinopril 10 milligrams orally once a day, atorvastatin 10 mg orally once a day clopidogrel 75 mg orally 2 times a day metformin 500 mg twice a day furosemide 20 mg orally twice a day metoprolol succinate metoprolol succinate orally 50 milligrams once a day, and then warfarin 2.5 milligrams orally twice a day. Family history, was mother passing away passed away from breast cancer, and father is alive with Alzheimer's in a local nursing home. Miss Palmer is an active smoker of 30 years and has considered quitting and would be open to learning about her options. Before feeling shortness of breath, miss Palmer was active and is Vital signs Vital signs show a temperature of 98.6, heart rate of 90, BP, blood pressure of 80 over 50, respiratory weight rate of 20, and O2 sat of 86%. Pertinent physical exam findings showed positive JVD, lower extremity edema, and PMI displaced laterally Upon auscultation, tachycardia with split s2, rails and wheezing were heard. Calves were non tender and pulses were equal and strong bilaterally. Lab results showed elevated troponin levels of 0.04 and elevated BNP of 4,000. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. EKG findings depicted sinus tachycardia with a left bundle branch block present and left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. 2 d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. All exam findings, tests, and imaging indicate a diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with functional class 4, class d, heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction of 30% with pulmonary edema and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Secondary diagnosis are hypertension, high cholesterol, and the diabetes. So miss Palmer will be admitted in serious condition to the ICU with vital checks every 2 hours and on strict bed rest. Nurses will maintain strict intake and output, daily weight checks, and DVT prophylaxis. Diet in the hospital will consist of a low sodium diet and patient will be kept on a saline lock keeping veins open. Holding all medications except for clopidogrel, 75 milligrams every day, and the warfarin, 2.5 milligrams by daily. I'd like to add a dobutamine IV drip and insulin sliding scale as well as a respiratory therapy of Vipap, 50%. Patient has been informed of all medication changes, serial troponin levels, and PTE INR labs are ordered with no additional imaging at this time. I will consult with interventional cardiology for CRTD and AICD placement. Education about maintenance of health, healthy diet, weight reduction, and no strenuous exercise until released by a physician has been covered with the patient."
"So patient is mister Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male with history of hypertension. He is presenting with shortness of breath and fatigue that started 2 weeks ago and is worsening. Patient states that he was walking with his friends when he felt symptom onset onset. Patient takes, Lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, because of his hypertension. He says that he's compliant with his medications. He did not take his listen and book for coming to see us today. He, describes his shortness of breath and fatigue as generalized. Symptoms are exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. At rest, he is okay. He can breathe normally. Symptoms are intermittent and is ranged 7 out of 10. For ROS, positives were wheezing, presyncope, fatigue, and palpitations. His vitals were 130 over 90 for blood pressure, heart rate 110, o two sat, 96, which he will be put on a nasal cannula, which I was I told him, and temperature was 98.6. Patient has surgical history of a cardiac cath that was done 1 year ago, which came back normal at the time. Pertinent familial history is his father died from an MI at 59 and mother died from sudden cardiac death at 40. Physical exam physical exam findings were positive for a systolic murmur with an s 4. PMI was laterally displaced, and there was a Gallup herd. There's no JVD, no carotid bruit herd. Lungs were cleared to auscultation bilaterally, and abdomen showed no bruities or, no pulsed out masses. There was no edema in the lower seventies. Profo pulses were present equal bilaterally. The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. The echo showed a thickened interventricular septum with left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrium enlargement. There was global hyperkinesia with check infraction of 60%. EKG showed a left ventricular hyper left ventricular hypertrophy with a large r wave and septal leads, and it had a normal sinus rhythm. Patient states he's a well balanced diet. He walks daily, exercises daily. He denies tobacco or illicit drug use. No alcohol use. Patient is a school teacher and married for 35 years with his wife. So based off the presentation, patient was diagnosed with familial familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy NYHA class 2. He was told that he will be admitted into the hospital, and he will we will be discontinuing the Lisinopril and adding in disopyrimide. I also notified patient that I will be referring him to a inter, interventional cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon for potential septic septectomy or alcohol injection."
"K. Hello. The female patient presents to the emergency department with chief complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient also notes a dull chest pain. Patient was awake, alert, and oriented. These symptoms began gradually over the last 2 weeks. The patient mentions that she is able to rest comfortably, but has some difficulty with physical activity which causes shortness of breath and fatigue, causing her to be at a NYHA class 2.

"Hi. Leslie, a 62 year old elementary school teacher, presented today with worsening tiredness and shortness of breath over the past 2 months. Dyspnea occurs with most activity, but it improves with rest. Her medical history included hypertension, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and she had a surgical history of cardiac catheterization. Her parents had a history of sudden death and myocardial infarction, and she currently lives with her husband. She's currently on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, 4 times a day, and prednisone, 10 milligrams, 4 times a day. During the physical exam and review of systems, I found fatigue, weight gain, jugular venous distension, palpitations, murmur, gallop, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, RAILs, and lower extremity edema. The lab results showed ventricular tachycardia, normal sinus rhythm, mediastinal fullness, and pulmonary edema. My assessment is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and the plan includes telemetry admission with vital signs checked every 2 hours, assisted ambulation, low sodium diet with strict monitoring, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, oxygen maintenance, and daily weight checks. Running medication, I want to continue Lisinopril and increase prednisone to 60 milligrams 4 times a day. And I also wanna administer amiodarone and furosemide intravenously. Amiodarone for a 150 milligrams and furosemide for 40 milligrams. I would like to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel as well due to the furosemide usage. And for consultations, I would like to consult interventional cardiology for AICD placement and radiology for FDG PET scan."
"Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female patient who came to the emergency department today complaining of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue for 2 months. She also reported an incident of palpitations and presyncope 2 months ago, which occurred in her home. 3 days ago, the patient was seen by her primary care physician for her symptoms, but when these symptoms worsen today, she was advised to go to the emergency room. Today, she reports of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and wheezing that occur with most activities and are relieved only with rest. She sleeps sitting up in a recliner to help with her breathing when she sleeps. Her symptoms have not been relieved by any medications or interventions thus far. Patient history is positive for hypertension, sarcoidosis, for which she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. She denies any allergies to medications. Her family history is positive for sudden death on the maternal side and myocardial infarction on the paternal side. Patient reports having a cardiac catheterization performed 1 year ago with all results normal at that time. The patient denied any history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. She reported having a balanced diet with 1 cup of, daily coffee and used to walk daily with friends prior to the onset of her current symptoms. She lives at home with her husband and works as a 5th grade teacher. Additional symptoms reported include 8 pound weight gain in 2 weeks' time and lower extremity swelling. Skin, heat, and neurological symptoms and systems were all negative. Patients' vitals today, red as having a negative. Patient's vitals today, red is having a blood pressure of 136 over 99, heart rate of a 110, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, though fatigued, and was seated leaning forward at the start of the exam. Carotid breweries were negative, but jugular venous distension was present upon examination. Cardiac exam revealed a systolic murmur with an s four gallop, and lung exam revealed rails and wheezing bilaterally. Her abdominal screening was negative. Bilateral pinning edema of the lower extremities was also observed with the patient denying any pain. Osteopathic screening revealed ropiness at the levels of T4 through T6 on the right side of the patient's thoracic back, spine. This patient's labs were significant for an elevated BNP. Echocardiogram revealed a restrictive myo cardiomyopathy, and chest x rays showed pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally with mediastinal fullness. EKG showed a nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. This 62 year old patient with a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis has major presenting problems of progressive dyspnea and fatigue with additional symptoms of palpitations and presyncope. The most likely diagnosis is restrictive myocardopathy due to sarcoidosis. I recommended admitting the patient to telemetry for full time cardiac observation in addition to consulting interventional, cardiology for possible AICD placement and radiology for FDG PET scan. For medications, I recommended with continuing her Lisinopril, increasing her prednisone dosage to 60 milligrams, and adding IV furosemide and IV amiodarone. The patient consented with this plan."
"Miss Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old white female with a history of hypertension who presents to the ED today with a 5 day history of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion. She reports that she had cold like symptoms 2 weeks ago, including fever, cough, and sneezing. When her current symptoms began 5 days ago, she reports that her sneezing, coughing, and fever had subsided, but that she now had persistent dull chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue, which was not improved by anything. She was evaluated at her PCP's office 3 days ago. When her symptoms did not improve, she was prompted to go to the hospital. She also notes that she cannot lay down at night to sleep because she has trouble breathing. She reports wheezing and heart palpitations. And of note, she is up to date on all of her immunizations. Her vitals include a heart rate of a 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 1 30 over 90, o two sat on room air was 91% with a respiratory rate of 2 of 20, and her temperature was 98.6. Her past medical history includes a cardiac cath 1 year ago. She notes no known drug allergies. Her hypertension is controlled with Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily by mouth.

"Case of cardiac sarcoidosis. The patient presented in the clinic this morning feeling fatigue, shortness of breath, and fluttering of the chest for the past 2 months. She was saw seen by her primary care provider, and it prompted her a visit to the ER. Her shortness of breath is worse than lying down, and she's experiencing near syncope. Upon reviewing, doing the review of systems of the patient, she recorded feeling fatigue, has experienced an 8 pound weight gain over the past couple of weeks, and experiencing, palpitations on top of the COPD. It's it's especially exaggerated whenever she, exerts herself and whenever she, lies down, so orthopedia, and has noticed some edema in her legs. The patient has a history of hypertension for which she takes 10 milligrams of lisinopril a day and has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams a day, and she has a previous cardiac catheterization history. The patient's mom passed away of a sudden cardiac death, and the patient's father died of a heart attack. The patient has been married for about 25 years and says that she has good social support. She eats a well balanced diet and walks for exercise. She does not report any history of tobacco smoking, illicit drug use, or alcohol use. She drinks about 1 cup of coffee per day, and she's living with her husband. She reports no, allergies to any medications. Her vital signs is slightly elevated heart rate of a 110 respiratory rate, a little bit elevated of 20. Blood pressure, 136 over 99, which is elevated, but not too concerning. And oxygen saturation is low at 91%. Upon reviewing her lab work, I saw an elevated BNP of 4,000, and her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, and a, normal cardiac silhouette. Her echo showed rigid ventricular wall motion indicating restrictive hypertrophic no. Just restrictive cardiomyopathy, and an ejection fraction of 55%, which is preserved. And the ECG showed nonsistent ventricular tachycardia with a normal sinus rhythm of a 100 and a normal axis. Her physical exam was positive for JVD, lower extremity edema, heart murmur, wheezing, and bibasalarials. Given the medical history, lab work, and physical exam, I am diagnosing the patient with cardiac sarcoidosis as my leading differential diagnosis. I admitted this patient to the hospital for telemetry, and the patient is in a serious condition, especially with the non sustained V TAC. I am going to monitor the patient's vital signs every 2 hours, and she will need assistance as she gets out of bed. For nursing instructions, I prescribe strict i's and o's, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula, and maintaining an o two stat of greater than 96%. I prescribed her a low sodium diet as well for IV, KBO, keeping the vein open, and a saline lock. The medications I would like to continue for her is Lisinopril, keep her on the 10 milligrams, but I would like to increase the prednisone to 60 milligrams. I would like to add in the odoroad, a 150 milligrams IV, and add furosemide 40 mg IV. I would like to do repeat, repeat, CNP, complete metabolic panel, as well as follow-up with interventional cardiology for a CID placement and a PET scan, with nuclear medicine.

"Female patient, miss Leslie Palmer, who came into our emergency clinic, for shortness of breath. 2 weeks ago, this patient experienced cough, fever, runny nose, and dull pain in their chest. That illness has since since resolved, but their shortness of breath has either gotten worse or, just not gotten better. Patient is in our emergency department after seeing their family care practitioner, 3 days ago, and they were encouraged to come into the ER as their shortness breath did not improve. Patient has experienced dyspnea and orthopnea, only relieved by sitting or sleeping in their recliner. Patient is also experiencing chest pain, pressure, and dull and a dull ache in their chest. Pain is constant and rated as a 2 out of 10. K. Patient is also has also experienced an increase in, 8 pound weight gain, over the past week or so, along with the experiencing fatigue and fever, but no chills. Patient's also experiencing muscle aches, but no headaches, no neck tenderness, or no neck tightness, no dizziness, no confusion. Along with the chest pain, patient is also experiencing palpitations and fluttering in her chest, but no pre syncopal episodes. For a past medical history, a patient has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years that's been well controlled. Patient is taking Lisinopril for the hypertension 10 milligrams, one time per day, and is diligent with her medication. Patient has no known drug allergies. Patient 1 year ago did go for a cardiac catheterization, for an abnormal EKG, but the catheterization showed no, no remarkable findings. No previous hospitalizations, and no pertinent medical history from, from her mom or dad or siblings. Patient is up to date with her current immunizations. Patient has no history of, less drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, one cup of coffee every morning, along with before these this, current episode of illness, regular or exercise regularly and was on a balanced diet. For my physical exam, I found the patient to have jugular venous distension bilaterally. When palpating the inferior lateral chest wall, mid clavicular chest wall in the left side, I noticed the point of maximum impulse for the heart had been shifted laterally. Upon auscultating the, both lungs, I heard bilateral RAILs along wheezing, in both the front and back, and plus 1 pinning edema in the, in the lower limbs below the knee. However, pulses were pedial pulses were were bilateral, strong, and, equal. For the patient's labs or I'm sorry. For the patient's vials, heart rate is 110. The respiratory rate is 20, temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 130 over 90, and pulse oximeter of 91%. For the chest x-ray, the patient's, chest x showed, pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. The doppler or the, the 2 d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an injection fraction of less than 30%. Labs came back with elevated troponin and elevated, brain natriuretic peptide, at 4,000, and EKG showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, left atrial sorry. Left axis deviation along with a premature ventricular contraction. So I would like to admit this patient to the hospital for myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy. I'd like to admit to telemetry for, for constant cardiac monitoring. Patient's condition is serious. No known drug allergies for the patient. Vitals I would like vitals taken every 2 hours. Activity as tolerated for the patient. Nursing orders, strict IO, daily weights taken, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula, just to make sure that her o two saturation stays above 96%. For diet, while she's in the hospital and likes low sodium and oral fluid restriction, Like to get a saline lock set up to keep the vein open. For medications, I want a patient to consider continue their lisinopril 10 milligrams once per day. I want to start the patient on acetaminophen, 6 25 milligrams every 6 hours, along with starting furosemide IV 40 mill 40 milligrams. I'd like the following labs ordered troponin continuous troponin levels. Like a CMP order for electrolytes and a repeat echo, 2 d echo, to hear an image of the heart. I'd also like to consult 3 different physicians, in inter interventional cardiology to talk to the patient about an implantable cardiac defibrillator along with a resynchronization device, to for those to be placed for the patient. And, also, while we're doing that, I'd like to get an endomyocardial biopsy to determine the infectious agent. Then I'd like to talk to infectious disease as far as getting starting the patient on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids. And I also like to consult the radiologist to get a contrast media enhanced MRI, to get a clear higher resolution picture of the heart. Okay. If you have any questions, please let me know."
"Okay. Hi, doctor Rollins. I just saw Leslie Palmer in room 7. He is a 62 year old male who presents today with dyspnea and fatigue with more than ordinary movement for the past 2 weeks. He He also notes some palpitations and wheezing with exertion, but denies any chest pain. He said resting resolves his symptoms, and he is comfortable at rest. He denies any recent illness prior to 2 weeks ago. His active medical conditions include hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He denies any prior hospitalizations, but surgical history includes a cardiac catheter 1 year ago. He had not received any results from it, but when his recent symptoms began, he called the office, and they told him they did not find anything, and so they referred him here. He's married and lives with his spouse. He is sexually active and is in a monogamous relationship. He knows he has a balanced diet and denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He has one cup of coffee every day. Prior to 2 weeks ago, he walked daily with a group, which he considered a social activity for him as well, and he would like to get back to doing that. He is also a 6th grade teacher. He told me that his father died at the age of 59 from a myocardial infarction, and his mother died suddenly at the age of 40. His physical exam showed no edema, negative Hohman sign, nontender and equal sized calves, and nontender chest with palpation. He has a systolic murmur and laterally displaced PMI. His lungs are cleared auscultation bilaterally. I evaluated Chapman's points, cart changes, and thoracic spine and did not find any osteopathic findings. He did not have any JVD or carotid bruise. His chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed left ventricle asymmetric ejection fraction of 60. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, tall r waves in the septal leads, and left ventricular hypertrophy. His labs were all negative. From my findings, I believe he's suffering from NYJ class 2, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I explained to him that I believed it had a genetic cause. I recommended that we admit him to telemetry and consider consult with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myomectomy and alcohol injection. I also believe that we should discontinue his Lisinopril and switch him to disopyramide and keep his activity as tolerated. Thank you."
"2 year old male presents to the emergency department department with complaints of dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and the feeling of passing out after going on a walk with friends. He claims it started 2 weeks ago while on a walk. And since then, he stopped walking. He stated that the dyspnea felt better while laying down. He also stated that it makes him feel weak and tired. In his review of systems, generally, he just felt fatigued but had no weight loss or gain or fever. He had no skin, no neurological, no musculoskeletal problems, no headaches, no hearing loss, no vision change, no trouble swallowing, or no stiff neck. He claims to have palpitations, but no chest pain. He has dyspnea that is better laying down, so no orthopnea. And he claims to have wheezing, but no cough. He has a history of hypertension, and he had a heart catheter placed and abnormal EKG 1 year ago. His father died of a myocardial infarction at 59, and his mom died suddenly of an unknown cause at 40. Patient is currently on 10 milligrams of lisinopril, and he has no known drug allergies. Patient has a well balanced diet, exercises daily, but stopped 2 weeks ago when symptoms presented. He has no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He drinks 1 to 2 cups of coffee daily. He's been married for 30 years and works as an elementary school teacher. His his vital signs were 96% oxygen, a 110 heart rate, temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and a blood pressure of a 130 knot a 130 over 90 millimeters of mercury. On his physical exam, I found a positive systolic murmur. His lungs were cleared a auscultation bilaterally. No jugular venous distension. No carotid bruise. No tenderness to chest palpation. No lower extremity edema. His pulses were full and equal bilaterally, and his calves were non tender. Diagnosed him with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to hypertension. And I ordered him to be admitted to telemetry under serious condition, and his vitals will be checked every 2 hours. He can do activity as tolerated. The nursing instructions are to check weight daily, and then strict intake and output, DVT prophylaxis, nasal cannula, and then maintain o 2 greater than 96%. He can have a regular diet. And like I said, he has no allergies. No labs were needed to be ordered. No imaging was needed to be ordered. And then for IV fluids, keep vein open. And then I added, 100 milligrams of diisopyramide, by mouth, 4 times a day. And then we're gonna discontinue the lisinopril. We're gonna consult interventional cardiology for an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. And then we're gonna consult a cardiothoracic surgeon for septal myectomy and alcohol injection. Thank you."

"Missus Leslie is a 62 year old female patient with a history of hypertension presenting today complaining of shortness of breath and general fatigue. Her vitals are a heart rate of 1 110, blood pressure of 1 30 over 90, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She states that her she had visited her PCP 3 days ago with similar complaints and was told to go to her was and was told to go to the ER if she if her symptoms persisted. Patient states that around 2 weeks ago, she felt sick with a fever and cough. She thought she had had a cold because symptoms had resolved within 5 days, but the feeling of breathlessness and fatigue remained. She admits that she feels a dull and achy pain or sorry, a dull and achy discomfort and feels out of breath during slight exercise, which improves with rest. Patient admits that sleeping supine makes her symptoms worse, causing her to sleep on her recliner. She denies any med she denies taking any other medications to improve her symptoms. She is an elementary school teacher and thinks that she could have gotten sick from school. She's currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for her hypertension with no allergies and is up to date with her immunizations. Missus Leslie has had a cap a cardiac cap procedure done 1 year ago with no hospitalizations. She admits that her mother has unfortunately passed away due to breast cancer, while her father is currently living in a nursing facility suited for Alzheimer's. Missus Leslie is also married. Currently, she denies any fever or chills, but states that she has noticed an an 8 pound weight gain. She denies any new rashes, lesions, bruising, or any other skin changes. She also denies any nuance that of headaches, hearing or vision changes, difficulty swallowing, neck stiffness, or neck stiffness. Patient admits to heart palpitation and slight chest discomfort, stating it as dull and achy, but denies any presyncope. She states that she does not have a cough, but has noticed a new onset of wheezing, dyspnea, and arthopnea, which she improves by sleeping on her recliner. She did patient denies joint and back pain, but it admits to muscle aches and some leg swelling. In terms of missus Leslie's social history, she has a balanced diet and has been able to exercise twice a week the twice a week before her symptoms started. She denies any illicit substance use, tobacco, or alcohol use, and her caffeine intake her caffeine intake consists of shrinking 1 up 1 cup of coffee every day. During her physical exam, she has, I noticed, JVD with no carotid bruise, a regular rate with no murmurs, friction rub, or gallops on cardiac auscultation. She does have a laterally laterally displaced PMI with no chest tenderness. On long auscultation, she has bilateral rails and wheezing present. Exam of her extremity show nontendered calves, a negative Hohmann's sign, plus one pedal edema with the DP and PT pulses full and equabilaterally. Her OGM screen showed no significant chart changes, and her cap and points were not tender. I discussed with missus Leslie that her heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were slightly elevated and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her odor saturation. Her card her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. Her two d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricle ejection fraction fraction of less than 30%, while her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I also advised that her lab values of troponin and BNP were elevated with BNP being at 4,000. I would place I would place the patient as a New York Heart Association functional classification of 2 with a slight limitation of physical activity while also admitting the patient to telemetry since her condition is serious. And basic consults with the interventional cardiologist to consult for an AICD CRTD placement, and endocardial biopsy with infectious disease, consult to for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoid therapy and a radiologist consult for media enhanced cardiac MRI. Nursing interventions include for the strict intake of strict intake and output of nursing dimension include a monitoring of strict intake and output, monitoring of daily weight and DVT prophylaxis while also maintaining an oxygen saturation above 96% with nasal cannula with 2 liters per minute. Her activity levels can be tolerated while having a slow low sodium diet with IV fluids to keep her veins open. I would also like to start with celestion furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 2 12 hours and acetaminophen 6 125 milligrams by orally every 6 hours, every 6 hours while continuing Lisinoprilen 10 milligrams daily. The furosemide would be to remove some of the fluid, to reduce the congestion on her heart. Acetaminophen would be for her chest pain, her chest discomfort, and lisinopril would be for her high, hypertension. I would also like to repeat labs, including CMP and serotroponin, given that we are to monitor her cardiac health and electrolyte levels given that we are start would should be starting furosemide as well as a BP two d echo to valid to further evaluate her to further evaluate her heart health."
"So I just met with Leslie Palmer. She is a 62 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents to the emergency department for the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. This patient states that approximately 6 months ago, she started experiencing these symptoms, even while she is at rest. She admits to dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and wheezing. She also states that she's gained £8 within the past 2 weeks and that she noticed that her lower extremities are swollen. She denies chest pain or any palpitations. 3 days ago, she saw her PCP who did labs on her and called her today and referred her to the emergency department, which is why she's here. She also states that she's been smoking 1 pack per day for the past 30 years, And then she also told me about her surgical history. So 12 years ago, she had bypass surgery. And then within the past 5 years, she's also had 5 stents. Her most recent stent was placed 1 year ago at her left anterior descending coronary artery, and her most recent echo, which was also 1 year ago, indicated that her left ventricular ejection fractional was at 40%. When I looked at her vitals, and even when walking into the room, she clearly looked to Kipnick. She showed that there was she had 22 breaths per minute, and she was also hypotensive at 80 over 50. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. So on physical exam, the patient was leaning over and gasping for breath. I saw, when I was auscultating her 4 posts, I saw that she was tachycardic with a split s 2, but I did not hear any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. When I was auscultating her lungs, I heard bibasilar reals. And then when I was assessing her lower extremity, I saw 1 plus pinning edema bilaterally, but her pulses were normal and equal bilaterally. When I was looking at her labs, she had elevated troponin and BNP. Her troponin was 0.04 while her BNP was at 4,000. Her test x-ray indicated that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and her echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. So it that is a 10% decrease, from last year's echo. When I was looking at her EKG, the most prominent finding was that she had a left bundle branch block, indicative of that s two split. And she had a normal sinus for them, and her her heart did have a left axis deviation, the left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. So based on her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, that's been worsening over the past 6 months, based off her physical exam and all of her imaging, I would say that she has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She's class 4 for the New York, standards of classification. Again, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. So I will admit her. I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU. I have consulted interventional cardiologist, for possible automatic implantable cardiomerder defibrillator and or a cardiac resynchronization therapy, at this time. And thank you so much for listening to my presentation."
"Palmer. Patient presents with, shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that the symptoms began a couple weeks ago and has progressively became worse over the last 2 to 3 days. Symptoms are exacerbated, with some exercise and only relieved by rest patient. Has not tried any, patient has not tried any other treatments besides rest and is helpful when he, like, lays down. Medication he's currently taking he's currently taking, clobasopril 10 milligrams. He is taking this for his diagnosis of hypertension. He is currently up to date on autoimmuneizations, and only hospitalization, was a cardiac cath, which was, which turned out to be normal about a year ago. Family medical history was normal on his mother's side and on his father's side. He his father had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 59, myocardial infarction. Diet is balanced. Patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily. Caffeine intake was 1 cup a day. He is employed as a 5th grade allergen school teacher where he does have insurance through them. He is sexually active with his wife. When going over the review systems, patient has presented with, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea. I went ahead and then performed the physical exam. Physical exam and findings included, no jugular venous distension. He had a crescendo, decrescendo systolic murmur and with s 4. The PMI was laterally displaced. Patient presented with no edema in the lower extremities, and impulses were normal bilaterally, And lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally. When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at 0, which is normal. BNP was at 90, which is normal. X-ray showed cardiomegaly. It did not show pulmonary infiltrates. Echo showed a left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%. EKG showed tall septal r waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was a sinus rhythm. It was tachycardic. Patient did have a pulse of a 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic. Oxygen saturation, in the room was 96%. Respiratory rate was at 16 breaths per minute, and temperature, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on the, diagnostic labs that were ordered labs and tests that were ordered, his physical exam, and past medical history. I believe this patient had has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I do suggest that we admit this patient to, telemetry, and we stop the Lisinopril, start him on a 100 milligrams of Dasopyramide, every day by IV. I also believe that we should refer the mister Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we where we possibly can implant, an AICD placement. I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery, for alcohol injections and septomyectomy to, reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction."
