" Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting to the ER with chest palpitations and syncope. The symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past two months and have increased dramatically over the past three days. They happen during any activity. The patient presented with an eight-pound weight gain, swollen legs, syncope, palpitations, coughing, and is currently sleeping in a chair. Her previous medical problems are hypertension, controlled, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Her current medications are prednisone and lisinopril with no known drug allergies. She does not use tobacco, illicit drugs, or alcohol. She walks on a daily basis, drinks one cup of coffee per day, and is an elementary school teacher. Her mother died from sudden death at age 40 and father from a myocardial infarction at 59. Her physical exam showed jugular venous distension, wheezing, and S4 murmur, lower extremity edema. Labs and imaging support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis that has infiltrated the heart muscle. Our plan is to admit to the hospital where she will follow up with a cardiologist and radiologist for a PET scan. We will up her dose of prednisone to 60 milligrams, add furosemide, and amiodarone. She will continue on her current lisinopril. Thank you."
" Hi, Dr. Rollins. I just saw Ms. Palmer in room six. She's a 62-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with a two-month history of worsening dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and near syncope. She stated that her symptoms improved with rest. However, they were brought on by most activity, including her daily tasks. She denies any chest pain, but also reported that some orthopnea causing her to sleep in her chair at night. She stated that she was seen in her family practice office three days ago where they did a 2D echo, EKG labs, and a chest x-ray. She stated that she was instructed by her family practitioner to come to the ER due to her worsening symptoms. Her active medical conditions include hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams, and pulmonary sarcoidosis, for which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams once daily. She reported that both medical conditions have been well controlled with her medications. She denied any allergies and reported that she had a cardiac cath about a year ago due to an abnormal EKG, but there was no coronary occlusion. She denied any prior hospitalizations and reported that she is fully immunized. She reports that her mom died suddenly at the age of 40, and her father died of a myocardial infection at age 59. She stated she has a great deal of information about her health, but she has no information about her health. She stated she has a good support system and lives at home with her spouse. She stated that she is sexually active with her spouse and that the relationship is monogamous. She stated she has a balanced diet and used to walk daily with friends until her recent symptoms have prevented her from continuing to do so. She denies any tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use, and reported that she drinks about one cup of coffee in the morning and works as a third grade school teacher. Sheиру Van Rondon, consumer growth average 않t clocksates from 14-18 year old with weekend reflux and HIV to palpation. I also evaluated anterior Chapman's points, posterior tart changes, and her thoracic spine, and I had no osteopathic findings to report. Her chest x-ray demonstrated mediastinal fullness with diffused pulmonary infiltrates and a normal heart size. Her echo showed a restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and her labs revealed a normal troponin but an elevated BNP at 4,000. Based on my findings, I believe she has sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy, NYHA class 3, and I explained that I believe the pulmonary sarcoidosis has begun to infiltrate her heart as well. I recommended that we admit her to the telemetry unit and consider consult with interventional cardiology for the placement of an AICD and consult with radiologists. I also recommended that we keep her on the lisinopril, increase her prednisone dose to 60 mg daily, add furosemide 40 mg IV, and also an amiodarone drip of 150 mg. And that is all. Thank you."
" She is 62 years old and presented to the emergency room. She said rest makes her pain or her shortness of breath better and also sitting up in her chair and exercise makes it significantly worse. So, Ms. Palmer is a female and her past medical history consists of diabetes, hypertension, as well as hyperlipidemia. She's been experiencing these symptoms for about six months. And went to her PCP about three days ago. They sent her to us. Now here she is. So, her medical history also includes diabetes. I'm not sure if I mentioned that. And I have my notes in front of me. The patient has a history of a... Bypass surgery. And got about five stents beginning place. The first one was placed 20 years ago. The most recent one was placed a year ago. And she was told she can no longer receive that sort of treatment. Excuse me. She appeared well. Alert. However, slightly fatigued. And she didn't have any skin lacerations and bruising. Just fatigue, shortness of breath, or chief complaints. She had no neurological signs. Her heart was beating fast, she said. So, syncope. And dyspnea and... Better with lying down. So, orthotimia. And... She had wheezing and rails. When she came in. So, the physical exam showed that she had jugular venous distension. As well as the wheezing and the rails. She also had pedal edema. And... Even pulses. She... Said her mother had breast cancer and her father had Alzheimer's. She... Is on a handful of medications. She's on amiodarone, warfarin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, metoprolol succinate. And... I had the history of the surgical procedures of the Shonda. She has no allergies. And... After all the diagnosis done, or all the... Um... Um... Um... A physical exam was done. Uh, we... Talked about our results together. Um, I presented her EKG, which showed a left bundle branch block, some left ventricular hypertrophy, but normal sinus rhythm. Her, uh, echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy. And her x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. As well as her labs. It showed elevated troponin of 0.4 and her BNP of 4,000. Um... After that, I had a heart attack. Um... After this, I... Um... Originally had the differential of potential... Um... Heart failure. Um... Maybe some musculoskeletal chest pain because she wasn't in the best health to begin with. And, um, ischemic cardiomyopathy... Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. And that is what it ended up being. Um... So... She... Was advised... Um... To be admitted to the ICU. And... Talked to an interventional cardiologist who would get her set up with an AICD and a... And... Um... Not place another stent, but place another cardiac device. Um... And... Um... And... Um... She was admitted to the ICU. So, she was being admitted on a low-sodium diet with, um, absolutely... Uh, the total restriction to exercise. Um, her nursing orders were strict IO, um, daily weights taken, and DVT peripheral access. Um... Yeah, moving ahead, she will see all the specialists, be in the hospital until... Um... She will be admitted to the ICU. Um... And... Um... She will be admitted to the ICU. Um... And... You will see all the specialists. Be in the hospital until she's feeling better. Um... And we did shift her medications, so she's only taking clopidogrel and warfarin and doputamine now. Um... And... She was put on an insulin sliding scale, and she was admitted because of her diabetes, as well as, uh, given a BiPAP machine to help with her shortness of breath. And the patient also had a history of atrial fibrillation. Um... When the patient was asked if they had medical insurance and they did, they have a pharmacy set up and they have support at home. They are in a good place moving forward and I'm hopeful that they will be able to receive the care that they need and continue on their journey to find help."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old male, presents with two weeks of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Patient also reports instances of feeling like he would pass out. He states that he is not short of breath at rest, but that even with walking short distances, he is short of breath. I think I would give him an NYHA score of class three. He is able to lay flat and denies any recent illness. He has a history of hypertension and is on lisinopril. His family history includes history of sudden death in his mother and an myocardial infarction in his father. He reports a year ago that he had a cardiac catheterization and that was normal. He does not smoke, drink alcohol, or do illicit drugs. He is a school teacher. Review of systems were positive for fatigue, warmth of the touched skin, palpitations, near syncope, wheezing, and shortness of breath. No chest pain or ortho... orthopnea. Vitals were remarkable for hypotension at 80 over 50 and hypoxia at 85% on Romare. Physical exam showed systolic murmur with S4 gallop. He had a PMI point of maximal impulse that was displaced laterally. Lungs were clear to association. There was no calf tenderness, no lower extremity edema. PT and DP pulses were full and equal bilaterally. Lab showed a troponin and BNP within normal limits. NKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and telseptal R waves. Echo showed thickened interventricular septum with an EF of 60%. Patients should be admitted to telemetry due to diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Secondary diagnosis would be hypertension. I advise the patient that we should discontinue lisinopril and start on diso pyrimidine. Consult was done with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgeon for either alcohol ablation or myomectomy. Patient is in agreement with plan. He was canceled on the further plan and he was alerted of the cause of his symptoms. Thank you."
" Good morning. Ms. Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting to us with shortness of breath. Patient states that they're physically active and exercise routinely, but started developing difficulty breathing when exercising. This encounter occurred prior to our visit several weeks ago and has had a gradual onset. Patient states that they feel short of breath when exercising and describes it as it's isolated only to the chest. It is aggravated when exercising and will leave by stopping physical activity. Patient has a prior history of cardiac catheterization and currently presents to us with a previous history of hypertension. Patient states do not have any known allergies. Patient follows a balanced diet, does not consume alcohol, tobacco, or any illicit drugs. The patient drinks coffee in the mornings and family history. The patient's mother passed away suddenly without reason and the father passed away from a myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Ms. Palmer is fatigued, reports presyncope, palpitations, and wheezing. She is currently on Lisanopril 10 mg once per day. The patient was alert and oriented. Physical exam found jugular venous distension, regular heart rate, wheezing, and rails. Upon physical exam, calfless non-tender presents lower extremity edema. Imaging found cardiomegaly and via 2D echo demonstrates left ventricle asymmetry and hypertrophy with ejection fracture of 60%. EKG presents tall R-wave and septal leads. Troponin and BNPR are within normal limits. Completion of physical exam and interview led to a suspected diagnosis of familial hypertrophic. Cardiomyopathy. Patient is classified New York Heart Association 2. Is to be sent to the telemetry unit under serious condition. Every two hours of activity is tolerated. Nursing intervention consists of strict INOs, O2 via cannula, and to maintain at 96%. Patients should be on DVT prophylaxis and patient can receive a regular diet. IV orders are KVO. We discussed the plan and is to discontinue. Discontinue Lisanopril and hold it and administer disoperamide. 100 milligrams PO. No labs and images are needed. We plan to consult cardiology for AICD placement, but we did not get to discuss cardiac surgery, but should be consulted for septomyectomy. Patient was briefed and asked if she had any questions for her care and agreed upon the treatment plan. Thank you so much. Thank you."
" I am reviewing today is a 65-year-old male named Leslie Palmer. He presented with shortness of breath and fatigue when exercising. He mentioned he had several episodes of near syncope. He went to his family medicine doctor where they ran multiple tests and he was recommended to come to the ER if he kept having these symptoms. He again had shortness of breath, near syncope. He was breathless and fatigued when he tried to exercise and his heart was beating out of his chest. When going over his past medical history, he had hypertension, which he was on 10 milligrams of lisinopril for. He had a cardiac cath a year ago due to an abnormal EKG. When discussing his family history, he mentioned his mother died suddenly. At 40 years old and his father was deceased at 59 from a myocardial infarction. When discussing his social history, he denied use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. He had a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables, protein. He went for regular walks before his shortness of breath and he was an elementary school teacher and had a spouse of over 30 years. He had no known drug allergies and when reviewing the systems, he appeared fatigued and complained of fatigue. He had no fever or chills, no weight changes, either loss or gain, no rashes, no bruises, no lesions on the skin. Heant findings were negative, so no headache, no stiffness of the neck, no visual or auditory difficulties. For cardiovascular, he did have those palpitations and your syncope, but no chest pain. He complained of wheezing and dyspnea, but orthopnea was okay. When discussing MSK, he had no muscle pain or joint pain and no edema in his lower extremity. He had no dizziness or confusion or gait changes. When reviewing the labs, his troponin and BMP were less significant than his regular clues of any component of his body and that gave him signs on his upper arm, joints, or his body type, including some blushes, sneezing, and drooling. Along withец Ty arguing that I am tired of profuseけど dang, I had no weight gain, made demonstration shots that제 did not feel like it was worth it on since I was 7 years old and sicknessLA appeared to beemorally significant for his body and that Mr. Ch proteins also indicated that it helps avoid the development of joint pain.

After reviewing everything, we came to the conclusion that this was familio hocum, so hypertrophic myocardial hocum. And when we looked at everything, we recommended seeing a cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon for septal ablation or some other sort of surgery to treat the septum, including the AICD placement from the cardiologist. This was the conclusion of this patient."
" Today I saw Dr. or Mr. Leslie Palmer. He's a 62 year old male. He came in complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. Uh, it has been progressing throughout the last six months with the last three days getting gradually worse, uh, and very severe today. He came to the emergency department at the recommendation of his primary care physician who suggested that he come. Um, he is having dyspnea even at rest and has to sleep upright. So orthopnea as well, uh, past medical history pertinent for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes diabetes for the last 15 years, atrial fib for the past five, his surgical history is positive for a coronary artery bypass graft and five cardiac stents. He has maxed out on stents and the cardiologist indicated no further intervention family history for maternal. His mom has breast cancer and his dad paternal has, uh, Alzheimer's, but he is still alive. As far as social history, it is positive for tobacco use. He is a smoker for the past 30 years. Um, no alcohol, no drugs. He is employed and has a regular balanced diet and he used to exercise, but is now unable to due to the shortness of breath and fatigue. And he lives with his spouse, his wife, current medications, atorvastatin 10 milligrams, clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day without atorvastatin was once a day. Ferozomide 20 milligrams twice a day, metaprolol sexinate 50 milligrams once a day, lysinopril 10 milligrams once a day, metformin 500 twice a day and warfarin 2.5 milligram twice a day. He is compliant in all those medications, no known drug allergies. His review, his review of symptoms is positive for fatigue, weight gain, um, shortness of breath. So the dyspnea, the orthopnea, he also has positive wheezing and lower extremity edema. He is awake and alert and oriented times four, but he is fatigued. Uh, vitals today, temperature 98.6, normal heart rate, 90, normal, uh, respiratory rate 22. So a bit of tachypnea rest or blood pressure, 80 over 50. So very low blood pressure and oxygen saturation, 86%. So low, uh, jugular venous dissension was present on physical exam, but there were no carotid breweries on auscultating his heart. I did hear a gallop, but no murmur, no friction rub. And he did have tachycardia with a PMI. Pulse of maximal impulse displaced laterally lungs, uh, were positive for rails and wheezing, but no chest wall tenderness. Um, as far as his lower extremities, I did auscultate or I did check his pulses. Those were full and equal. He did have some fetal edema, but his calves were non-tender and human site negative imaging. Um, we had a chest x-ray results with cardiomegaly pulmonary edema, 2d echo with indicated dilated cardiomegaly pulmonary edema, and a chest x-ray with ejection fraction, less than 30. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, but left bundle branch block and his labs troponin was elevated at 0.04 and BNP was elevated at 4,000. So I indicated that he's diagnosed with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. I did explain this to the patient. His New York heart association classification is four as he is unable to carry on physical activity, even at rest his disposition. We should admit him to the hospital. He's not able to carry on physical activity, even at rest. We should admit him to the ICU in serious condition, check his vitals every two hours. I think he should be on strict bed rest and the nurses should check strict ins and outs daily weight and check for DVT prophylaxis. I recommend a sodium low sodium diet. And if we indicate fluids, we should keep his vein open for now. Um, as far as medication changes, I would like to continue his warfarin and his clopidogrel, uh, change all his other ones. Um, add on disopiramide 100, which is a very good one. Um, and then I would like to recommend him to once a day and change that metformin to an insulin sliding scale. Since his oxygen saturation is so low at 86, I would like to place them on BiPAP and, uh, order the labs serial troponin and PTINR for consultation. I'd like to consult interventional cardiology so that they can check for if he is a candidate for pacemaker, either AICD or CRT. Other than that, we should get Mr. Palmer into the ICU and see if we can have him. So I would like to recommend him to a doctor. I would like to recommend him to a doctor. I would like to recommend him to a doctor. I would like to get his shortness of breath and fatigue figured out and get that oxygen saturation much higher. All right. Thank you."
" I met Mr. Leslie Palmer, who's a 62-year-old male, and presenting with episodic chest pain, sorry, episodic near syncope associated with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, feeling raspy and wheezing for the past two weeks. He says symptoms get better with rest and describes it as severe in nature. Episodes last 30 to 45 minutes. He denies any prior history of this and says this is new in the past two weeks. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, and he's currently on 10 milligrams of lisinopril for that once a day. He has a history of a cardiac catheterization that came back normal. His family history was significant for his mother passing away at 40 from what was predisposed to be a sudden cardiac death. His father passed away at 69 from an MI. His review of systems was positive for fatigue, lightheadedness, near syncope, palpitations, wheezing, and dyspnea. He denied any fever, chills, weight changes, skin changes, any myalgias, joint pain, chest pain, orthopnea, no neck swelling, trouble swallowing, or anything of that nature. His vitals. His heart rate was elevated at 110. Otherwise, his vitals were normal. His oxygen was 96%. His respiratory rate was 16. Blood pressure, 130 over 90. And his temperature was 98.6. On exam, he had positive JVD. His cardiovascular exam was regular rate. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. His PMI was... His heart rate was displaced laterally. And we noted bibasilar rails and wheezing present. He had plus one pitting lower extremity edema, but otherwise full DP, PT pulses, no calf tenderness, or Hohmann's sign. My assessment is that the patient was awake, fatigued, and oriented. And then going through his results, his chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly. Otherwise normal. 2D echo showed left ventricular asymmetry with hypertrophy. EF of 60%. His EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 60. That was the rate. With normal axis, LVH criteria, and peak R waves in septal leads. His troponin and BNP were both normal. And with this information, I diagnosed the patient with... With... Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I gave him a class two New York Heart Association. And I gave him a secondary diagnosis of hypertension. I decided to admit him to telemetry. His condition was serious at the time of admission. I ordered vitals every two hours and activity as tolerated. For nursing orders, I added in a strict IO, a daily weight, oxygen via nasal cannula, two liters per minute to maintain that SAT of 96% or greater. In addition to DVT prophylaxis. For diet, I ordered regular diet for him. And then to keep the vein open for IV. And then as far as his medications goes, I asked him to discontinue the lisinopril and start the disopiramide at 100 milligrams PO. And for consults for this patient, I requested he be seen by interventional cardiologist. And removing some of those Resus bre unrelated to his therapy. Yes. Without saying anything. So, we'll continue to come back after this. Thank you for attending this show. We'll see you next time. Have a great day. Thank you, guys. Itcar beautiful, welcome opportunities. Thank you all for joining with me. Thank you"
" pleasure of seeing Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old female in the emergency department today. She complained of shortness of breath and fatigue for the last two months, with intermittent episodes of palpitations and feeling like she may pass out. She has orthopnea and must sleep in her recliner. She is limited in her ability to walk with her neighbors due to her symptoms. Her symptoms are relieved by rest. She is currently taking lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams daily to treat hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, respectively. She was diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She has no known drug allergies. One year ago, she underwent heart catheterization, which was negative, and she denies other surgeries or hospitalizations. Her family history is pertinent for a father who passed away at age 59 from a myocardial infarction and a mother who passed away at age 50. She is unexpectedly at age 40, likely due to sudden cardiac death. She has a sister who has no medical conditions and is living. She eats a well-balanced diet, does not use illicit drugs, tobacco products, or alcohol. She consumes one cup of coffee a day. She is an elementary school teacher. She lives at home with her husband. She has no children. She used to regularly walk with her neighbors before the onset of these symptoms. She denies fever, fever, and fever. She is a mother who has had a lot of weight loss, but she is a mother who has had a lot of weight loss. She is a mother who has had a lot of weight loss, but she is a mother who has had a lot of weight loss, chills, or weight loss, but endorses fatigue and an eight-pound weight gain over the last two weeks. She denies any skin changes, such as rash, bruising, lacerations. She denies any changes in her vision, changes in hearing, difficulty swallowing, or headaches. She denies any gait disturbances or dizziness. She endorses lower extremity edema, but denies joint or muscle pain. She denies chest pain, but endorses palpitations and presyncopal sensations. She denies any syncopal episodes. She endorses shortness of breath, orthopnea, and wheezing. She denies cough. Vital signs reveal that she is tachycardic at 110 beats per minute, hypertensive at 136 over 99, tachypneic at 20 respirations a minute. She is afebrile, and she is hypoxemic at 91 percent. Physical exam revealed venous, jugular venous distension, pardon me. No carotid bruise. She has a regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur and S4 gallop. Pulmonary auscultation reveals bilateral rails. Lower extremity, pardon me, lower extremity plus one petting edema is noted, and normal pietal pulses are present. No calf pain. Labs showed normal troponin levels and an elevated BMP at 4,000. Chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema and Pombroker-Stein suggestive of sarcoidosis. Echo cardiogram showed non-dilated ventricles with an increased ventricular wall thickness with an ejection fraction of 55 percent. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute. Normal access with less than 30-second non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Given her history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, I suspect she is having a restrictive cardiomyopathy due to cardiac infiltration of the sarcoidosis. She has a New York Heart Association Class 3. Secondary diagnosis. Her IV. I will order CMP labs and refer to interventional cardiology for an AICD placement and radiology for an FDG PET scan.

" A 62-year-old female presents with complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She was afebrile tachycardic with a heart rate of 110, O2 sats of 91, which was low, pulse of 110, blood pressure 130 over 90, and respiratory rate of 20. Patient had previous viral infection approximately two weeks ago and has continued to have heart palpitations, substernal dull chest pain, orthopnea, dyspnea, and shortness of breath at rest. Previous history positive for high blood pressure and currently takes 10 milligrams of lisinopril once daily. Patient had previous visit to their PCP, and they referred them to the ED for their symptoms. Patient has had muscle aches, joint pain, and weight gain of eight pounds in the past two weeks. NYHA score four since they have experienced symptoms at rest. Physical exam was positive for JVD, but no carotid bruise, regular heart sounds with no murmurs. PMI was displaced laterally, but the chest wall was not tender. Bilateral rails and wheezing were auscultated. Lower extremity pitting edema was found, but both pulses, DP and PT, were strung bilaterally. No calf tenderness was noted on physical exam. Negative family history for cardiac issues. Father is currently living with Alzheimer's in a home facility, and the mother died of breast cancer at age 89. Patient does not use alcohol, tobacco products, but does drink one cup of coffee daily. They have a regular balanced diet and exercise consistently about three times a week. They have no known drug allergies and history of a cardiac cath one year ago. The troponin was elevated at 0.1, and BMP was elevated at 4,000. Chest x-ray was positive for pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction of 30%. EKG was positive for PVCs, right bundle branch block, left axis, and sinus tach. This is consistent with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient will be admitted to telemetry, vitals, Q2 hours, and activity as tolerated. Nursing orders to monitor. Ins and outs, daily weight, DBT prophylaxis, and start on O2 nasal cannula to maintain O2 sats above 96%. Diet is low sodium and fluid restriction. Keeping patient on lisinopril, adding 625 milligrams acetaminophen by mouth, Q6 hours, and furosemide, 40 milligrams IV. I ordered serotroponins, a CMP, and a repeat 2D echo. I also put in consults to interventional cardiology for AICD and CRTD placement, and a CT scan. Cardiac biopsy. Another consult to infectious disease for immune globulin and glucocorticoids, and a consult to radiology for a media-enhanced MRI to detect inflammation of the heart. Patient is expected to be admitted and discharged. They were instructed to maintain healthy weight and healthy lifestyle once discharged, and activity once cleared by a cardiologist."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer. He's a 62-year-old male, presents to the ED with shortness of breath and fatigue. Two weeks ago, he was walking with his buddy. He began to feel short in his breath, felt tired, and felt like he was ready to pass out. He felt concerned about that because every time he exercised, he would feel like he was ready to pass out, got really tired. He saw his family medicine doctor three days ago, and they told him to get, if it got worse, to go to the emergency room, and that's why he's here. He's alert and ornate in times four. He is fatigued right now. His vital signs, his heart rate was 110, a little high, and his pulse ox was 96%. His temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Now, with the HPI and review systems, he had no chest pain. He did have palpitations, but it got worse with activity and exercise, but it got better with rest, and he was negative for orthopnea. Past medical history, he had hypertension. He had a cardiac cath one year ago due to an abnormal EKG, but the results were normal. Now, his family medical history, his mother had a sudden cardiac death. His father passed away of a myocardial infarction. His mother passed away at age 40. His medications right now, he's on lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day. He has no drug allergy. Social history was negative for anything pertinent. He's an elementary school teacher. He does use moderate amount of caffeine, and he used to exercise and was active, but he can't right now because of the fatigue. He has a well-balanced diet, and he's married. Now, review systems, he was positive for T, palpitations. He was negative for chest pain, and he was positive for presyncope episodes. He did have dyspnea. He was positive for wheezing. He was negative for head, ears, eyes, neck, and throat, negative for skin, negative for musculoskeletal, and negative for neuro. On physical exam, he did not have any jugular vein distension nor bruise, but he did have a heart murmur with an S4 heart sound gallop. And his lungs were clear bilaterally and equal, and no lower extremity edema, no deep vein thrombosis as well, negative Hohmann's sign. His x-ray showed cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema. Echo showed asymmetric hypertrophy with ejection fraction about 60%, showing that there's some hypertrophy going on. EKG had tall R wave in the septal leads and normal sinus with 11 jugular hypertrophy criteria, and labs are normal with the EKG echo x-ray. This was a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun. I was very excited to talk to him today, and I'm glad to be here. And I'm happy to share with you some of the things that I've learned from him. So, I'm going to talk about one of the things that I've learned from him. I'm going to talk about the stage II NYHA II class heart failure. So, we are going to, I was, what we can run this over, but thinking of admitting him to telemetry vitals every two hours, ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis, daily weights. Put him on oxygen because that pulse oxygen was a little low. Put him around two liters. Keep it above 96%. He is serious. We're going to have activity as tolerated though. We're going to keep that vein open. We're not going to do any fluids right now because it's some type of heart failure. We don't need to do that right now. Now we're going to keep them on regular diet. We're going to discontinue that lisinopril and put them on disapurimidol. Sorry about that. 100 milligrams, four times a day. Make sure he doesn't have any antiarrhythmias. I did consult interventional cardiology for an automatic internal cardiac defibrillator. Make sure that's pumping well and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myectomy and alcohol injection. Okay. Now, sir, I hope you have a great day. This was Mr. Leslie Palmer. Great guy. You have a good day."
" Today I have Ms. Leslie Palmer. She's a 62-year-old patient who comes in with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient states that she went to a family medicine clinic three days ago where she had some tests ordered, and the results are here in the ER. She presents to the ER after having worsening of her symptoms. She states her symptoms began two months ago where she had episodes of shortness of breath. She had a fluttering heart, so she endorsed palpitations. And during these episodes, it felt like she was going to pass out. These episodes were short in nature, but they worsened with activity, but they weren't present at rest. And she said that she was sleeping in a chair, and that improved her symptoms. She has a surgical history of a catheter, a cardiac cath. She has a medical history of hypertension, and 25 years ago she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. She denies any allergies at all. She states that she consumes a balanced diet, and she can no longer exercise due to her symptoms. And she denies any alcohol use, any tobacco use, any drugs. She says she drinks one cup of coffee a day. She's an elementary school teacher. She says she's sexually active with a male partner who she's currently living with. And she states that she has no recent hospitalizations. And she states that her father died from a myocardial infarction at 59 years old, and her mother died suddenly at 40 years old. She's compliant with her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. And she's also taking prednisone 10 milligrams for her. She's also taking prednisone 12 milligrams daily. And she's also taking prednisone 12 milligrams daily. She states that she's up to date on her vaccinations as well. For her review of systems, it was negative for weight loss, but she did have 10 pounds of weight gain. She endorses fatigue. She denies any fever or chills. She states that skin findings were negative. There was no head and neck findings significant. She states that she doesn't have any chest pain at all, but she does have palpitations. She does have that. She does have presyncope that I discussed. She denies any cough or wheezing, but she does endorse some dyspnea and orthopneum. She endorses right leg swelling as well. She denies any muscle pain or any back pain or any joint pain. There was no neuro findings, so no dizziness, no changes to her gait, and no confusion at all. Her vital signs were she had SpO2 of 91%, respiratory rate of 20, heart rate 110, and her blood pressure was at a 90% level. She had a high blood pressure, which is a very high level of blood pressure. She had a high blood pressure, which is a very high level of blood pressure. Temperature 98.6 and a BP of 136 over 99. And she was alert oriented and she was awake and fatigued as well. On physical examination, she had JVD and no bruise. Her heart rate was regular and she had a systolic murmur with an S4, but she had no rubs or gallops. Her PMI was in a normal position. There was no chest wall tenderness. Her lungs were present with a bi-basilar rails and wheezing. She had a high blood pressure, which was a very high level of blood pressure. She had one plus pitting edema on her lower extremities. She had dorsal spetus and posterior tibialis. Pulses were full. No tender tenderness in the cap and her home inside was negative bilaterally as well. She had no tissue texture changes on thoracic spine screening. No red reflexes, no somatic dysfunction in the thoracic region as well, and no interior Chapman points positive. Chest x-ray presented with pulmonary edema, medial sign of fullness, normal cardiac silhouette, and her 2D echo. Presented with restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG presented with normal sinus rhythm with non-sustained VTAC. Her CBC, CMP were negative. PTI and R were negative. Her troponins were negative, but her BMP was elevated at 4,000. And I believe that she has class III New York Heart Association heart failure with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. So our plan is to admit her to telemetry. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. We're going to do a CT scan of her heart. She's in serious condition. We're going to get vitals every two hours. She is allowed to get out of bed with assistance. We're going to get daily IOs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis. We're going to give her some O2 via nasal cannula. We're going to maintain her O2 set at more than 96%. She's going to be placed on a low-sodium diet on a saline lock. We're going to continue Lisinopril 10 milligrams in amiodarone. And we're going to put her on amiodarone 150 IV, up her pregnant life. We're going to put her on prednisone to 60 milligrams daily and adferosamide 40 milligrams to diureser. We're going to get a repeat CMP and we're going to send her to interventional cardiology for AICD placement. And we're going to send her to a nuclear med or radiologist for an FDG PET scan. So thank you very much. It was great. It was a pleasure to see this patient."
" Mr. Palmer presented to the ER. He is a 62-year-old white male, and he presented to the ER with complaints. Two weeks ago, he noticed he was having dyspnea and fatigue when he was going on his daily walk with his friends. And that typically doesn't happen. And since those two weeks, he's noticed it's gotten worse. And particularly this morning, what made him came into the ER was that his dyspnea was so bad that his wife brought him into the ER. And he didn't have any pain. And he did say that one of the leading factors is that when he rests, the shortness of breath gets better and the dyspnea gets better. He hasn't tried any treatments. He just described it as regular severity. And really, the only complaint he came in was with shortness of breath and fatigue. Looking into some relevant history, he does have a history of hypertension. Which he did. He takes lisinopril-4, which he was taking lisinopril-4 regularly. He also, on his family side, his mother had died of a sudden cardiac event. His father had passed away from an MI, age 59. His past surgical histories, he had a cardiac cath put in. But other than that, no other hospitalizations. No other relevant history. He's not a smoker. He doesn't take any illicit drug use. Doesn't drink. He has like the moderate cup of coffee a day. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He's not a smoker. He did say he was pretty active regularly. It was just now with the shortness of breath and fatigue, he can't exercise as much as he used to be able to. So then I conducted a physical exam examining cardiac and pulmonary systems. When listening to his hearts, I did notice a positive systolic murmur and S4 gallop. I also noticed that his PMI was laterally displaced. However, everything else was normal. I didn't hear any rails. I didn't hear anything. Lungs sounded good. I found nothing in the OMT screen. Oh, along with dyspnea, he did mention wheezing that he would occasionally have. His vitals, when I had examined them, the heart rate was particularly high. It was at a heart rate of 110. His blood pressure was normal and his oxygen was normal. But I told him that we would be concerned about that heart rate being particularly high. And then I moved on. I was able to review labs and imaging with him. So his troponin and his BMP were normal. All his blood work labs were normal. His x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy. I mean, sorry, his echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy. And so it is EKG with tall R-ceptal waves. And with that finding and the physical exam finding, and his family medical history, we came up with a diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So I told him that we would be admitting him to the telemetry unit, along with changing his lisinopril, like stopping lisinopril and putting him on disapiramide. And that he would be able to get out of bed as needed, but we would have his vitals checked every two hours. We'd give him a couple standard nursing regulations, like O2 nasal cannula, DVT prophylaxis. All of those. And I did let him know that we would refer him to an interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement, along with potentially referring him to a cardiothoracic surgeon, since he does likely have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, to see if we can get either a myectomy done or some alcohol inventions to help relieve some of that left ventricular outflow obstruction. I asked him if he had any family or friends in the area. His wife brought him in, so I let her know that we were going to admit him and if she could bring some stuff that he would need and if they needed any support other than that."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old male who presents to the emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue for the past two weeks. The patient reports worsening of symptoms with exertion and also experiences palpitations and shortness of breath with activity. He states that at times he feels lightheaded and like he might pass out but denies any syncopal episodes. He reports the symptoms improve with rest and denies chest pain. The patient went to his primary care doctor today for the worsening symptoms where they did diagnostic testing and sent him to the emergency department for further evaluation. The patient has a medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. His immunizations are up to date and he has no previous hospitalizations. He had a heart catheterization 10 years ago, which was normal. His mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40 and his father passed away from an MI at 59. He denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. He has a balanced diet with regular exercise. He's an elementary school teacher and lives with his wife. He takes lisinibrel 10 milligrams once daily for his blood pressure and he has no known drug allergies. Review of systems was positive for fatigue, generalized weakness, presyncope, and palpitations, shortness of breath. He denied fever, chills, weight changes, bruising, lesions, rashes, weakness, sensory changes, headaches, changes in vision, neck stiffness, hearing changes, and chest pain. Vital signs, his heart rate was 110, 96% oxygen saturation. He was not able to breathe for a long time. He had a heart rate of 11.5, a heart rate of 11.5, a heart rate of 11.5. He had a heart rate of 11.5, a heart rate of 11.5, a heart rate of 11.5. His blood pressure was 130 over 90. His respiratory rate of 16, temperature 98.6, and blood pressure of 130 over 90. He was awake alert oriented and no acute distress. He's well-developed, well-nourished male. He had no JVD, no carotid bruit, no chest wall tenderness, no epigastric bruit or tenderness, normal posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, negative Holman sign, no lower extremity edema or calf tenderness. He had a normal rhythm. He had a systolic murmur with an S4, and the PMI was displaced laterally. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and he had no chart changes. For his labs, his troponin and BMP were both within normal limits. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis. LVH voltage criteria and tall R waves in the septal leads. So for this patient, we're going to admit him to telemetry for the diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class 2, and a secondary diagnosis of hypertension. His condition is serious and will be getting vitals every two hours. He has no known drug allergies. Activity is tolerated. We'll put him on a regular diet and have DVT prophylaxis and an O2 oxygen nasal cannula as needed to maintain his health. He will maintain a saturation of greater than 96%. We'll put in an IV fluid saline lock, discontinue the lisinopril, and start desopiramide 100 milligrams four times a day. We don't need any other labs or imaging at this point. We will consult with interventional cardiology for potential AICD placement, and we'll also consult cardiothoracic surgery for possible septal myectomy or alcohol injection. We discussed the plan of care with the patient. He denied any other questions, and he understood and agreed with the plan. The patient has insurance and lives with his wife, who is his support system."
" 62-year-old female by the name of Leslie Palmer. She is presenting to us today with a chief complaint of dull, constant chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and wheezing for the last two weeks. Of note, patient does endorse having flu-like symptoms about two weeks ago and endorsed experiencing a fever, cough, and rhinorrhea at the time, which has since resolved. However, the dull chest pain and shortness of breath she felt during the flu is still present, which is why she is with us today. Of note, she has been experiencing palpitations, myalgia, joint pain, breathlessness, and fatigue with activity. Ms. Palmer is normally active twice a week, but lately has been unable to exercise due to fatigue and shortness of breath. She also endorses orthopnea and must, quote, sleep sitting up in a chair every night, end quote. She has a history of hypertension and takes a lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral every day consistently. She has no known drug allergies, no illicit drug use, alcohol, or tobacco use. Of note, patient did specify that she had a cardiac cath conducted one year ago during her annual physical, which yielded a total of 10 milligrams per hour. Of note, patient did specify that she had a cardiac cath conducted one year ago during her annual physical, which yielded a total of 10 milligrams per hour. No other hospitalizations, and her maternal family history includes a mother who died of breast cancer and a father who has Alzheimer's and is currently living in a nursing facility. Her support system at home is a husband, and she works as a elementary school teacher. She denies any dizziness, confusion, sycopy, headache, back pain, or neck pain. Her vitals include a temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, heart rate 110, respirations 20, blood pressure 130 over 90, and O2 stats at 91% on room air, which I've placed on my screen right now. Her heart rate and respirations are consistent with her palpitations. During her physical exam, I did hear some bilateral basilar rails and wheezing, as well as notice some JVD in her neck and one plus pitting edema in her lower extremities. Her heart was regular, no murmurs, no rashes, no glurogity, and she had no abdominal or carotid bruises. No catheterinous negative home and sign, and her carotid and dorsalis pedis pulses were present, two plus equal and bilateral. Her labs imaging included an elevated troponin of 0.1 and BNP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed a cloudiness of her long vessels and curly B-lines consistent with pulmonary congestion or pulmonary edema, as well as cardiomegaly due to an increased cortithoracic ratio. Her 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30%. Her EKG showed sinus tech with a right bundle bench block, left axis, and a PVC. Due to her presentation and diagnostic imaging today, I believe that she should be admitted to telemetry with a diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and is a class 2 on the NYH scale for heart failure. Secondary diagnosis is hypertension. I consulted interventional cardiology for AICD and CRTD pacemaker assessment, and radiology for a contrast MRI. During the encounter, I did not get the chance to, but I would have liked to consult infectious disease for consideration for aminogodlin or glucocorticoids for treatment management. I also ordered a diagnostic serial troponin, CMP test, and a repeat 2D echo. I also would have liked to order lisinopril, 10 milligrams per oral, Tylenol 625 milligrams per oral every six hours for her pain, and furosemide 10 milligrams IV to reduce her edema and heart strain. To also reduce the stress on her heart, I would also like to order a low sodium diet and oral fluid restriction to maintain her O2 stats above 96% via nasal cannula. Patient was understanding to the plan and agreed to service, and she was advised to continue her balanced food diet and increase her physical activity. Thank you."
" complaint with a complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. He said this happened while he was exercising. He was on a walk and he just out of nowhere got a short of breath. This happened about two weeks ago. Just got really out of breath and proceeded to almost pass out. Felt like he was going to pass out. His past medical history is that he has hypertension. He has a cardiac cath. His family history is that his mother died of sudden death and his father died of an MI. I think his mother was 40 and his dad was 59. His sister is fine though. So that heart cath and he had an EKG and a heart cath. Those were both about a year ago. His social history is he doesn't use a heart cath. He doesn't use a heart cath. He doesn't use alcohol. He doesn't use tobacco. He doesn't use illicit drugs. He is an elementary school teacher. He eats a balanced diet and he drinks a couple cups of coffee a day. Exercises as often as he can. He said usually walks every day but for the past two weeks hasn't been able to because of this shortness of breath that he's been having. He lives with his wife as well. His previous medication that he was on, was lisinopril, 10 milligrams per oral. He has no known drug allergies. His review of systems is that he has fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, wheezing, and dyspnea. Patient on initial examination was awake and aware and oriented. His heart rate was 90. Respiratory rate was 22. So very slightly tachypneic and his blood pressure, he was hypotensive. It was 80 over 50, I believe. And O2 level was 86%. So we on physical examination, he had no carotid bruise, no JVD, no Number three. tobaccolements andenga.

His are Littleottorbustibus x Extral Nope No Tobaccoiger, let's see, no JVD, regulatory, regular heart rate. Murmur was present with an S4 and a systolic murmur was present with S4 and a gallop. His PMI was normal. He was clear, his respiratory area was clear to auscultation, nothing obvious in there. His calves were non-tender. He had no fetal edema. He had a negative Hohmann sign and all of his peripheral pulses were full and equal. His chest x-ray appeared to have cardiomegaly and it was kind of iffy, but I said that he had pulmonary edema. It just was a little cloudy in there, not incredibly obvious, but a little cloudy. His 2D echo said that his left ventricle was asymmetric and hypertrophic. With an EF value of 60%. His EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria and total R waves in septal waves, really pointing to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His troponins were within normal. They were zero. His BMP was less than 100%. His level of dyspnea was, I said it was an NYHA score of three because he said he really struggled to breathe when he would just walk on very slight things. So he's a marked limitation of physical activity. Patients, I had decided it would be a quality idea to admit to telemetry patients. The condition was serious. Ordered vitals for every two hours and activity with assistance. Nursing interventions, all kind of generalized and normal. Strict IO, O2, two liters per minute via nasal cannula. Maintain O2 stack within 96%. DVT prophylaxis. Diet regular because he doesn't have anything that, you know, he's not going to have a lot of weight. So he's going to have to go to the doctor.

" Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting to the emergency department with fatigue, heart palpitations, and dyspnea, both exertionally and at rest. The patient stated that she had been experiencing symptoms for around two months with gradual worsening and was instructed to go to the ED as per her primary care provider. The patient denies any chest pain or any other pain. The patient is a well-developed, well-nourished 62-year-old female in no immediate distress upon entering exam room. The patient states she has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis, reports cardiac catheterization one year ago with no major complications. The patient reports that her father died due to myocardial infarction at 59 years old and that her mother died at age 40 from unknown causes. The patient's medications include lisinopril at 10 milligrams once daily and prednisone 10 milligrams once daily. There are no known drug allergies. The patient needs a balanced diet. No alcohol. Drug and tobacco use with moderate caffeine consumption. The patient states that she used to walk regularly but cannot anymore due to her symptoms. The patient is an elementary school teacher and is in a monogamous sexually active relationship. Her vitals are as follows. Heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure at 136 over 99. Respiratory rate of 20. She is satting 91 on room air and her temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Review system shows. Fatigue, unexplained weight gain, leg edema, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea as well as orthopnea. Physical findings show jugular vein extension but no carotid bruise. Patient does have a systolic murmur with an S4. No regurgitation with PMI displaced laterally. Bibasilar rails can be heard along auscultation. Peripheral leg edema is noted. Patient is negative for Holman's sign. Chest x-ray shows. Highly lymphadenopathy but no pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. 2D echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. EKG shows sinus rhythm, normal axis with a brief period of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Lab findings include negative troponin and a BNP of 4,000. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure. But the most likely diagnosis. Is restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to sarcoidosis. Given patient's history of sarcoidosis and imaging findings. Showing high lymphadenopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy on the echo. Patient was admitted to telemetry with activity out of bed with assistance and nursing instructions to be given as follows. Strict monitoring of intakes and outputs. Daily weight checks, DVT prophylaxis, and O2 therapy via nasal cannula with goal of maintaining oxygen saturation at 96%. Patient is also placed on a low sodium diet and saline lock is initiated. Patient is to be continued on lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily. But the prednisone will be increased to 60 milligrams once daily. And amiodarone 150 milligrams IV as well as furosemide 40 milligrams IV should be started. Complete metabolic panel was ordered. And a consult will be made to interventional cardiology for consult for implantation of an automatic implantable cardiovertebral. Or defibrillator or an ASCD as well as a consult in nuclear medicine for an FDG."
" A 62-year-old male patient presented to the clinic today with shortness of breath and fatigue. In the history of the illness, the patient stated that he was on a track on a run or on a walk and then experienced a shortness of breath and fatigue as well as palpitations while he was walking with his friends. The patient mentioned that he experienced palpitations within the next 20 minutes upon the onset of the shortness of breath. This event occurred a couple weeks ago and has not improved ever since. And the patient's shortness of breath and palpitations as well as fatigue exacerbated with physical activity. In terms of the review systems, patient experienced fatigue, no cough, fever, malaise, or any kind of illness or any kind of cold-like symptoms, but experienced weight gain for the past couple of weeks. Patient mentioned that there was palpitations but no chest pain. Along with the palpitations, the patient experienced dyspnea and raspy breathing. In terms of the past medical history, the patient has a history of receiving a cardiac catheterization in an outpatient clinic. Medical history-wise, the patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, no known allergies. In terms of the social history, the patient's on a balanced diet, tries to exercise regularly, doesn't take illicit drugs, tobacco or alcohol, drinks water. The patient is also a teacher, so is currently employed. Patient has been sexually active with his significant other, but hasn't tried ever since the onset of symptoms. The patient has no hospitalizations. And in terms of family history, the patient's mother experienced a sudden death in the family. And his father-in-law- He was a father, experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 69 and unfortunately died from that. Patient's medication- The patient is on lisinopril 10 milligrams QID. In terms of the physical history, the patient tested positive for jugular venous distension, but had no carotid bruise. In terms of the heart auscultations, they were irregular. There was no murmur, frictional rub or gallop. The PMI was displaced laterally. And- There was no chest wall tenderness. In terms of the Chapman point, there was no such- There were no positive Chapman points. For the lungs, the patient had a bivacillary rate and experienced wheezing in the upper quadrant. In the superior lobes. For MSK, physical exam, there was a non-tender calf with pitting edema of the lower extremities. But the pulse, the dorsalis pedis, and the dorsal extremities were not seen. The dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibialis pulses were present and symmetric. In terms of the vitals, the patient- The only abnormal vital was the heart rate, which was 110 beats per minute. All the other vitals, temperature being 98.6. Blood pressure was 130 over 90. The pulse ox was 96%. And the respiratory rate was 16 beats- Was 16 per minute. All those were- All those others were normal. In terms of diagnostic imaging, the patient- The patient had cardiomegaly in the chest X-ray. The 2D echo revealed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy. And that's because of an increased intraventricular septum. As well as an enlarged left ventricle- Left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. With an abnormally tall R wave in the septal leads. Particularly in V1, V2, and V3. And the CT showed that the intraventricular septal hypertrophy due to a large anterior voltage. And that suggests that there's a- This fits the LVH voltage criteria. The labs were unremarkable in terms of everything being normal. So, troponin levels were normal. BNP was normal. CBC and CMP were normal. I proceeded with the EMR and the consult. So, I diagnosed the patient as familial hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. And explained that the disease in which the- This was a disease in which the heart muscle became thickened. Which makes it harder for the heart muscle to pump blood. And because it's so thick, it'll cause abnormalities in the electrical conduction. In terms of the New York Heart Association, the classification was 2. Because of the fact that with slight- There's slight limitation of physical activity. Even though the patient was comfortable during rest. He mentioned that the physical activity resulted in fatigue, palpitation, and shortness of breath. Which is why it led me to believe that it was NYHA classification of 2. For the EMR- For the EMR treatment plan and counseling, I admitted- I told the patient that he was going to be admitted to telemetry because it was a serious condition. With Q2 vitals activity as tolerated. Nursing interactions include INO daily weight obtaining- Daily weight measurement, DVT prophylaxis. And the patient would be on- 2 liters per minute. On the nasal cannula to make sure that the pulse ox was above 96%. Diet wise, I instructed the patient to be on a regular diet. IV fluids wise, it would be KVO. In terms of medications, I instructed the patient to be discontinued on Lisinopril. But started on Disopramid. With 100 milligrams QID. There was no diagnosis. No diagnostic labs or imaging required. I did mention to repeat an EKG reading once at the hospital. Just to make sure that there was no repeat of the TAL. Just to make sure that there was not- Just to track the TAL R waves. If there was any future EKG abnormalities. In terms of specialists or consults, instructed the patient to visit- To have an interventional cardiology visit them for an AICD placement. And cardiothoracic surgery to visit for septomyomectomy. Or alcohol injection to reduce the LVOT."
" Okay, so the patient that presented to me today was Leslie Palmer. She's a 62-year-old female. She was alert, awake, fatigued, and oriented, but her vital signs showed that her heart rate was 90, her blood pressure was 80 over 50, respiratory rate was 22, O2 sat was 86, and her temperature was 98.6. Her chief complaint was shortness of breath and fatigue at rest. She described progressively worsening shortness of breath over the last six months. Her shortness of breath was noted while lying down at rest and when physically active. She noted that she began sleeping in a chair at night to relieve her shortness of breath when sleeping. Her past medical history was pertinent for hypersensitivity. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, as well as atrial fibrillation diagnosed five years ago. Her medications include, at the time of presentation, her medications included metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams, lisinopril, 10 milligrams, metorvastatin, 10 milligrams, metformin, 500 milligrams, furosemide, 20 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, and warfarin at 2.5 milligrams. Her surgical history shows a coronary artery bypass grafting, as well as five drug-eluting stents within the last year. Family history showed that her father is alive at 89 years old, but does have Alzheimer's disease. Her mother is deceased at 80 years old due to breast cancer. Social history shows that she follows a balanced diet, moderate exercise, no illicit drug use, and has been На hypersensitivity for until 2021. If she is a substance of Francisco Cat dig ghee, naturally, she has was negative for any bruises, rashes, or anything of the sort. Her head and neck exam was negative. Cardiovascular exam showed an irregular rate with no murmur or friction rub, as well as a regular PMI was normal upon inspection. Her respiratory, or her, sorry, according to her, she was not presenting with anything. Her pulmonary ROS shows wheezing, orthopnea, and dyspnea. Her MSK, she claims a lower extremity edema, and neuro was good. On her physical exam, we found in the neck, no carotid brewery. She did have jugular venous dissension. She was tachycardic. She had a normal PMI, no friction rub. Or murmur or gallop noted on auscultation. Respiratory exam showed bivasal or rails and wheezing. And that concludes the physical exam portion. So for orders, we sent her to the ICU, took vitals every two hours, put her on strict bed rest, a strict IO, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. We placed her on BiPAP. For labs, we ordered PT-INR, and CERN-2. For her medications, we discontinued metoprolol, licinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and furosemide. We continued her clopidogrel and warfarin, and we added dobutamine, as well as placed her on an insulin sliding scale. And post-visit, we consulted interventional cardiology for potential AICD or CRTD placement. Thank you, and this concludes my case presentation. Thank you."
" Okay, start. Today I assessed Leslie Palmer. She came in with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue with a two-month history of this. She went and saw her primary care physician three days ago and then got a lot worse today, called them, and they said to come to the ED. So she presented to the ED with a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. She has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoid. She had a cardiac cath a year ago and it came back normal. She had a family history of cardiac sudden death on her maternal side. Her mother passed away at 40 and her father passed away from a heart attack. Her vitals were 139 over 99, blood pressure, her O2, she was a little bit hypoxic, she had 91, a little bit of tachycardia, she had 110, respiratory rate was 20, and temperature was normal at 98.6. And so then we did an intake, we did social history, she doesn't use alcohol, drugs, tobacco, she drinks coffee just a cup a day. She's currently employed as a school teacher. She is unable to exercise. She's an NYHA of three. So rest does help, but every other kind of activity does make her have her symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath. She's currently for her blood pressure taking lisinopril 10 milligrams and for her sarcoid she's taken prednisone 10 milligrams as well. She's got no allergies. She had a bit of a weight gain, about eight pounds, and again, fatigued, no skin, ROS, no HE and TROS. She did have a presyncope. She's never passed out, but she does feel like she's going to pass out. She said she had a fluttering in her chest and actually used the word palpitations. She's got dyspnea, orthopnea, wheezing, some lower extremity edema. She did have JVD. All of her neuro ROS was negative, no gait changes, no confusion. She's awake, alert, oriented. She's just tired, fatigued. She didn't have any cardiac brew or no carotid brewies. She did have JVD. She had a regular heart rate. Sure, PMI was normal on inspection. There was a murmur. There was an S4 murmur and there was a gallop, no friction rub, and no regular rate. She did have wheezes and bilaser by 0. She had no chest wall tenderness and was not in respiratory distress. Her calves were not tender. She did have plus one pitting edema. Her peripheral pulses were full and equal. She did not have a home in sign. Then we did her imaging and her x-ray. She showed normal heart size. She did have pulmonary edema and some mediastinal fullness as well as she had the characteristic pawnbroker sign on chest x-ray. Her labs did show an elevated BNP at 4,000 and I informed the patient of what that meant. Her echo came back with a restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness. She showed up Goodman so close. She had LEMN, yang-tzu of 35 percent and a Cratella significant starting hours and was able to recognize the valence T direction . Chapter six, schectal negritosis, drug equipment, highly sensitive resolution. Inspection and recovery is very effective. And I continued her lisinopril at 10 milligrams. I upped her prednisone to 60 milligrams amiodarone because her EKG did show that she had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. So she had three or more of the consecutive ventricular beats in V1, V2, and V3. The axis was normal and it was a normal sinus rhythm as well. Um, so she had an EKG cardiac dysrhythmia of non-sustained V-tax hill. We would place her on amiodarone 150 IV. Um, so I also put her on some furosemide 40 milligrams IV, uh, to help with that fluid in the legs. Um, no endocrine, no BiPAP. Uh, we did order a CMP. Um, we did no more diagnostic orders and I consulted a radiology and an interventional cardiologist. Um, for an AICD placement and a pop, a possible PET scan. Um, other than that, um, I believe everything else on her physical exam we have covered. Um, and we admitted the patient to telemetry. Thank you."
" I just met with Leslie Palmer. He's a 62-year-old male who presented to the ED with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue that's gradually worsened over the past six months. He's unable to carry out any exercise and is having symptoms at rest. He expressed that he's been sleeping in a chair at night because he can't lay down because of his shortness of breath. He denied any pain and stated that he went to his family med doc three days ago and they told him if it gets worse to go to the ED. So that's why he came in. His past medical history, he has hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and AFib. And his immunizations are up to date. For his meds, he's on atorvastatin 10 mg every day, clopidogrel 75 mg every day, brosemide 20 mg twice a day, metoprolol succinate 50 mg every day, lisinopril 10 mg every day, metformin 500 mg twice a day, and warfarin 2.5 mg twice a day. He has had a cabbage 12 years ago. And he had five stents placed. And the cardiologist said he doesn't qualify for any more stents. His dad is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. And his mom died of breast cancer. He has a balanced diet. He walks every day. He doesn't use illicit drugs. He's a pack-a-day smoker. And we talked about potentially quitting. He doesn't drink alcohol. Drinks a cup of coffee a day. He's a school teacher. And he's married and lives with his family. He has no allergies. And for his review systems, he expressed fatigue and an eight-pound weight gain in the past two weeks. He has swelling in his legs, no skin, eyes, ear, nose, and throat, or neural problems. He denied palpitations, syncope, and chest pain. And he has wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. His vitals, his temp was normal at 98.6. He has a heart rate of 90. Respiratory rate was up at 22. His BP was hypotensive at 80 over 50. And his oxygen was low. His blood pressure was low at 86%. On physical exam, I found no carotid bruise. He did have JVD. No murmurs. He was tachycardic. His PMI was displaced laterally. He had wheezing and rails. But he wasn't in respiratory distress. And he had just-well tenderness. His calves weren't tender. He had pedal edema. And his posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses were full and equal. On his imaging, he had cardiomegaly and pulmonary. He also got an echo done that showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an injection fraction less than 30%. And he also got an EKG. That was normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. His troponins and BNPs were elevated on his lab work. So my differential was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis dilated myocardial myopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy. But I diagnosed him with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Because of his medical history of having hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and having all those stents placed. And his echo showed that he had a reduced ejection fraction. So I went ahead and admitted him to the ICU. He's in serious condition. Get vitals every two hours. Still strict bed rest. Strict IO, daily weight, CBT prophylaxis. He's on a low-sodium diet. KVO IV fluids. I discontinued all his meds except for his copetagrel and warfarin. And I added a dobutamine IV drip. Put him on insulin. He's on siding scale. And he's on BiPAP for his low oxygen. I ordered to repeat the PTT-INR and serial troponin labs. And I ordered him to have a consult with the interventional cardiologist for an ICD or CRT placement. But he has a good support system with his family to take care of him. And he seemed like he was in good spirits and just really wanted to have his symptoms go away. So hopefully the medication we give him will help with that. I gave him x Hahah www.spainlessdroportion Senson here in the New Haven, Ohio. Place of assisted low oxygen medication. The naarr przesu То X Fern there's a utól with oxygen and blood. But it doesn't hip to do. So."
" you're doing well this morning. A 62-year-old man came into the ED this morning. Name is Leslie Palmer. He presented to the ED with shortness of breath and fatigue that has been worsening over the last six months. States that his shortness of breath happens at rest and gets worse with any physical activity. His heart rate was 90, his respiration rate was 22, BP was 80 or 50, and O2 stats were down low at 86%. He has a past medical history of AFib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. He has had a triple bypass in the past and five stents. His mom died of breast cancer. His dad currently has Alzheimer's. He's a pack-a-day smoker, in good health, good diet, good exercise, no alcohol or drugs. He has a long list of medication, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. On his review of systems, he presented with fatigue, as I mentioned, weight gain, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and he did present with lower extremity edema. On physical exam, he had jugular venous distension, an irregular rate with a split S2. His PMI was displaced laterally. He did present with rails and wheezing, but no chest wall tenderness. And he did present with fetal edema. On his chest x-ray, it showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo showed DCM with left ventricular gestation fraction of less than 30%. And his EKG showed a left bundle branch with LVH-voltage criteria. His troponin was 0.04, and his BNP was 4000. I did diagnose him with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA class 4. And I admitted him to the... I see you because of that. Vitals every two hours, strict bed rest, low sodium diet, KBO fluids. I kept him on his clopidogrel and his warfarin, but I took him off everything else. And I added dobutamine IV. And I put him on an insulin sliding scale. I put him on BiPAP because his O2 stats were so low. I also had a PT-INR because he's still on warfarin and serotonin to make sure that's going in the correct direction. And then I referred him to the interventional cardiologist for IACD. And CRTD placement. Thank you so much and hope you have a good day."
" Today, I had the pleasure of seeing 62-year-old male Mr. Leslie Palmer. He presented with shortness of breath and fatigue and was referred to the ER by his family medicine physician. His vitals were at a heart rate at 90, blood pressure at 80 over 50, and a O2 set of 86% and respiratory rate of 22. He has been diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He has had a triple bypass surgery done as well as five stents put in, and his last stent was in the LAD in June of 2022. His current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metformin, furosemide, metoprol, succinate, and warfarin. His physical exam revealed JVD, tachycardia with a split S2, rails in the lungs, a displaced PMI. In terms of relevant ROS, he has had a weight gain of about eight pounds recently and has been experiencing fatigue, orthopnea, and dyspnea. He smokes every day, and I did counsel him on stopping to avoid exasperating the symptoms that he's currently experiencing. Lastly, I looked at his labs and imaging and reviewed it with the patient. His troponin and BNP levels were elevated. His x-ray revealed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, and his echo revealed left ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of less than 35%. And according to his EKG, it looks like he had normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, and a left bundle branch block. I diagnosed him with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and referred him to the cardiologist. I also took him off all of his medications except for the clopidogrel, warfarin, and added dobutamine. I also took him off all of his medications except for the clopidogrel, warfarin, and added dobutamine. I also took him off all of his medications except for the clopidogrel, warfarin, and added dobutamine. And he has now been admitted to the ICU. Thank you."
" reporting on Mrs. Leslie Palmer, who presented today to the emergency department, complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath, and adult chest pain that began about two weeks ago. She noted about this time about two weeks ago, she was sick with flu-like symptoms, but these symptoms resolved about five days ago, these flu-like symptoms specifically. However, her fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain have only gotten worse over the past several days. She knows that she is unable to exercise to her normal limits without these symptoms, and she's been sleeping in a chair at night due to pretty severe orthopnea. She denies taking anything to alleviate her symptoms, and she rates her symptoms at a 2 out of 10. She does have a past medical history of hypertension, for which she is taking lisinopril. She also has a surgical history of a cardiac catheterization. She is an overall pretty healthy patient who exercises regularly and has a balanced regular life. She has a balanced regular life. She has a balanced regular life. She has a balanced regular diet. She's also up to date on all of her immunizations. As for her ROS, she does present with fatigue, and she notes some recent weight gain that's abnormal, about eight pounds in the last week. She does have chest pain and discomfort, and she also notes some fluttering in her chest. She notes dyspnea and orthopnea. She also notes joint aches and pains, along with lower extremity edema. Her vital signs today were temperature at 98.6. She was tachycardic at 110 beats per minute, and tachypneic at 20 rates per minute. Her blood pressure was also a little bit elevated. Her blood pressure was also a little bit elevated, and she does present with a lot of blood pressure. Her blood pressure was also a little bit elevated, and she does present with a lot at 130 over 90, with her O2 a little low at 91%. She did, on physical exam, she did have jugular venous dissension. Her PMI was displaced a little bit laterally, but she was at a regular rate with no murmur, friction rub, or gallop. On respiratory exam, she did have wheezes and rails, but there was no change in her blood pressure. She did have a little bit of a low blood pressure, but she did have a little bit of a low blood pressure. She did have a little bit of a low blood pressure, but she did have a little bit of a low blood pressure. As for extremities, she did have obvious lower extremity edema, but her pulses were full and equal, and her calves were not tender. She also had a negative homin sign. For her chest x-ray, she did have some cardiomegaly and some pulmonary edema with a normal mediastinum. Her echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at less than 30%. Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with sinus tach and a right bundle branch block. Her troponin was a little bit elevated, and her BMP was elevated at 4,000. So with all of this, I decided that she's probably experiencing myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So with this, I did decide to admit her to telemetry. We're doing strict I's and O's with DVT prophylaxis, a low sodium diet. I'm going to place her on acetaminophen for some of this chest pain. I'm going to keep her on her list in April, but I am going to put her on furosemide to clear out some of that fluid. As for lab work, I'm going to put her on a sedum and a fin for some of this chest pain. I'm going to do a CMP to monitor her potassium since we're adding the furosemide. I'm also going to check serial troponin levels since they were elevated. I'm going to repeat her echocardiogram. I'm also going to consult an interventional cardiologist, a radiologist, and an infectious disease physician. Interventional cardiologist to consider an AICD CRTD plan. Infectious disease physician to take a biopsy and assess immune globulin or glucocorticoids. And then consulting radiology to do an MRI to look for any changes that could be caused by this myocarditis. Thank you very much."
" Leslie Palmer presents as a 62-year-old female patient for chief complaints of diphthia and fatigue. She also complains of heart palpitations and presyncope. She first started noticing her symptoms about two months ago and went to her primary care doctor three days ago for these symptoms. They are running tests now and results are not known at this time. Symptoms have worsened in the past few days, so she was instructed by her primary care provider to come to the emergency room. She notes that symptoms improve when she lays in her chair and with rest, when she sleeps in her chairs and with rest, and symptoms worsen when she lays flat and with most physical activity. Patient has a symptom, a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. 25 years ago, she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. She has no known drug allergies.

" I saw Mr. Palmer today. Leslie is a 62-year-old male who presents to the ER for the chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. Mr. Palmer has been experiencing these symptoms for six months and saw a family medicine physician three days ago who ordered tests but did not go through them with him. The PCP referred him to the ER for which he is here today. He reports symptoms that have progressively been worsening and he needs elevation when sleeping using a recliner. The fatigue and shortness of breath have been constant at rest and worsened with any and all physical activity. Mr. Palmer has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with metoprolol succinate 50 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, metformin 500 mg, furosemide 20 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. And he has been experiencing symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath for six months and has been receiving treatment for six months. His social history includes a balanced diet, moderate exercise with daily walks with friends from his neighborhood. But recently he reports having increased shortness of breath by walking. He has no drug or alcohol use and smokes a pack a day. He consumes one cup of coffee every morning and is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with his wife. His surgical history includes a triple bypass and a stent every year for the past five years. However, on his last visit, his surgeon informed him that he will no longer be getting any more stents due to his ejection fraction being below 40%. He is a school teacher and his family history includes his mother passing away from breast cancer and his father who is still alive in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. He is also up to date on all his current immunizations. He appears awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued. And after a thorough review of systems, pertinent positives include an eight pound weight gain in the past, two weeks, fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and wheezing, as well as swelling in his legs. His vital signs showed normal temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90. He was to picnic with a respiratory rate of 22, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80 over 50, and hypoxic with a pulse ox set of 86%. Physical exam findings showed jugular venous distension, no carotid breweries, tachycardia with a split S2, and a displaced PMI laterally. His lungs on auscultation showed bibasilar rails and a pitting edema was also palpated in his lower extremities. Diagnostic lab work showed an elevation of troponin and a BNP of 4,000. Chest x-rays showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. EKG was interpreted to show normal sinus rhythm and a left bundle branch block. This led to a decrease in the amount of blood that was released. This led me to my diagnosis to be ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which is classified as class IV heart failure by the New York Heart Association. The patient will now be admitted to the ICU on strict bed rest and will be needing BiPAP as well to tackle the hypoxia. We will be administering his clopidogrel or for an endobutamine as well as an insulin sliding scale. I will also be ordering troponin and PTI in our lab work. I will consult with an interventional cardiologist to discuss treatment with a CRTD or a possible AICD as well. Thank you."
" So Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female coming with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. So she had been seeing her PCP, and over the past two months, her symptoms of shortness of breath have worsened. And so her doctor told her to come into the emergency department. So she presents today and has shortness of breath. She also complains of palpitations, presyncope. She says the symptoms have been worsening over the past two months, but she denies any sort of chest pain. She says the shortness of breath is constant, and she feels it even when she's at rest. In terms of her medical history, she has a history of hypertension and a history of sarcoidosis. She does not have any allergies. She actually says that she used to exercise once per day, but because of her symptoms, this is decreasing, and she's no longer able to walk every day like she used to. She says that she has gained eight pounds over the past two weeks. And then on physical examination, I found a regular venous extension, no carotid bruise. I listened to her heart. It sounded regular. I did hear a systolic objection murmur with an S4, no rails, but I did hear a gallop. The PMI was normal. There was no chest wall tenderness. I was listening to her lung sounds. I heard bivalve or rails, along with wheezing. While looking at her legs, I saw pitting edema on both legs. Her pulses were equal, and her calves were non-tender. Looking at her labs, her deponement was normal. Her BMP was 4,000. The X-ray, the heart size looked normal. I did see some, like, pilar consolidations. On echo, it showed restricted cardiomyopathy with the increased wall thickness, but her injection fraction was normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and right bundle branch flaw. So with all of this, I think what's going on is that she is having a sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy, an exacerbation of her pulmonary sarcoidosis. So what I want to do is I want to admit her to the telemetry unit. I'm going to consider, or, continue her lisinopril. I'm going to add on imiodarone and increase, add on imiodarone and furosemide. I'm also going to increase her prednisone dose. I want to order another CMP so we can monitor that BMP. I'm also going to consult the cardiologist and the radiologist so we can get some, some more lab results in."
" a 68 year old female that came into the office today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. Two weeks ago she presented to an office due to her fever and cough and then five days ago she had to go back because of her chest pain and shortness of breath. Three days ago she went to another doctor and they told her to come here due to her symptoms not improving. She says the shortness of breath does not improve with Tylenol or I'm sorry her physical activity causes her shortness of breath. She has a constant chest pain that is dull and is not alleviated by Tylenol. She said out of a scale of 10 her pain is two. I give her a NYH score of 10. I give her a score of three due to her decrease in physical activity and she has to sleep in a recliner. When I did my physical exam there was a positive JVD as there were no cardiac bruise. There was some lower extremity edema. The neuro exam was negative. Pulmonary she had rails with dyspnea and wheezing. Cardiac. Her PMI was displaced as well as experiencing palpations and chest pain. And then just in general she was oriented but she was fatigued and had some slight weight gain probably due to the edema. Her labs are CBC, PTINR negative. Troponin was slightly elevated. BMP elevated. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Our 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block as well as a left axis deviation. After speaking to the patient and doing the physical exam I decided that she had myocarditis dilated. Dilated cardiomyopathy. So we are going to admit her to telemetry. Condition serious. She has no known drug allergies. Vitals every two weeks. Two hours. Her activities as tolerated. She's going to be on strict IO daily weight. DBT prophylaxis. Her O2 stats were low. It's at 91%. So we're going to put on O2. Be a nasal cannula and maintain an O2 stat of 96%. Put on a low sodium diet and fluid restriction. Put on a saline lock KVO. She is currently on lisinopril 10 milligrams. So we're going to keep that. But we're also going to add 625 milligrams of saline. So we're going to keep that. We're also going to add 625 milligrams of saline. So we're going to keep that. But we're also going to add 625 milligrams of saline. So we're going to keep that. But we're also going to add 625 milligrams of acetaminophen every six hours. Help with the pain. And then furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to try to get rid of some of that fluid. We're going to keep an eye on her troponins. We are going to repeat the echo and we are going to do CMP. We will be consulting interventional cardiologist for a CRTD and AICD placement to help get her rhythm back to normal. As well as a infectious disease. We are going to do a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. We are also going to consult a radiologist to do a contrast media enhanced MRI. A patient does have a husband that is here at the hospital. He will be helping her and supporting her with that. And other than that, her vitals, heart rate was elevated at 110. As I said, her O2 stats were low. And she had a BP of 130 over 90."
" Good afternoon. I would like to present to you a patient I've just finished seeing at the emergency room. Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presents with the chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue with accompanying chest pain. These symptoms have been occurring over two weeks and are worsening. She describes the chest pain as sharp, central, non-radiating, and a two out of ten severity. Symptoms are worsened with some exertion and symptoms are alleviated by rest and sleeping in a sitting position. No treatments have been tried at this time. The patient also noticed a recent illness consisting of fever, headache, coughing, and runny nose that dissipated five days ago, most recently evaluated by her PCP three days ago. Mrs. Palmer currently takes lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day for her hypertension and claims no known drug allergies. Social history is significant for a cardiac catheter. One year ago with no complications. Family history showed a living father with Alzheimer's and a deceased mother who passed with breast cancer five years ago. Mrs. Palmer's social history is described as a regular diet with no tobacco, drug, or alcohol use with moderate caffeine intake and insufficient exercise. She's currently employed as an elementary school teacher and lives at home with her husband of 30 years. Review of systems demonstrated an alert-oriented patient in pain. There was a weight gain. The patient was a little over 2 pounds, over two weeks noted, as well as lower extremity edema. Cardiology noted heart palpitations, chest pain, and pulmonology assessment demonstrated orthopnea, wheezing, the shortness of breath. Dermatology, heat, and neurology. Review of systems raw, non-contributory. A focused physical exam was assessed with negative Chapman's points and bilateral equal TART changes anteriorly and posteriorly. Physical exam was significant for jugular vein distension, 1 plus pitting edema, 2 plus bilateral pulses, bibasilar rails, regular heartbeats with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops with a displaced PMI laterally. The Hohmann sign was negative. Vitals were assessed and were significant for tachycardia at 110 BPM, elevated blood pressure at 130 over 90, tachypenic at 20 breaths per minute, and hypothyroidism at 120 BPM. The patient was assessed with a low blood pressure at 130 over 90, toxic at 91% oxygen saturation. No fever was noted. Labs revealed elevated troponin at 0.10 and elevated BNP at 4,000. Chest x-rays showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, while echo showed enlarged left ventricle with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed a left axis sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions and a right bundle branch block. A diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association stage 2 was made with admission to telemetry. Patient will be placed on acetaminophen, 625 milligrams by mouth every six hours, as well as furosemide, 40 milligrams via IV, while continuing her lisinopril. I will consult an interventional cardiologist for CRT, AICD placement, as well as endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease will be consulted for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, and radiologists will be consulted for immediate enhanced MRI. Diets will consist of low sodium and oral fluid restriction. We'll be placing an IV fluid saline lock with strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and O2, via nasal cannula, maintaining the O2 saturation above 96%. Vitals will be taken every two hours, and we will order a serotroponin and a repeat 2D echo. Thank you very much."
" So for today's case, we have a 62-year-old male presenting with fatigue and shortness of breath. Patient report symptoms begin about six months ago, but then two days ago, they got worse. So he decided to come in and see us. So he described a dyspnea and a fatigue that is constant even at rest, in which I gave him a NYHA class four. He feels quote unquote generally tired, sitting up relieves the dyspnea, activity worsens it. So he has orthopnea and sleeps upright at night because it feels better for him. He has not tried any self-medication, no self-treatment. He rates the fatigue as an 8.9, 8 or 9 out of 10. So his vitals, he was hypotensive with 80 over 50. He has tachypnea, which fast heart rate, no fast breathing rate, sorry, respiratory rate of 20. His low oxygen SpO2 was 86%. So he was, so in his review systems, he was positive for fatigue. He recently gained eight pounds in the last two weeks, which suggests fluid buildup. He has wheezing. Shortness of breath and orthopnea. His bilateral lower leg edema. Past medical condition, past medical history consists of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes for the last 10 years, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery. And he's an active smoker. Medications, he takes atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. So on the physical exam, the remarkable positives, he has tachycardia with a split S2. He has jugular venous distension. His PMI is displaced laterally. He has rails, wheezing, lower extremity edema. All the other findings for negatives were unremarkable. Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo shows normal sinus rhythm. I mean, sorry, his EKG, my fault. His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria. On his labs, his troponin is elevated and his BNP is 4,000. His echo shows dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. The primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. And the secondary diagnosis that I gave him were because of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. So his actually his family history, that's pertinent. So his mom is passed away at 80 from breast cancer. He's been in the hospital for a long time. He's been in the hospital for a long time. He's been in the hospital for a long time. And his father is still alive. He's 88. He has Alzheimer's. So that's the for that. So the prior we're going to so now for our treatment plans, I want to admit him to the ICU. His condition is serious. I want vitals done every two hours. I want to limit him to strict bedrest. Nurses are going to give him strict IO, daily weight and DVT prophylaxis. For fluids, he's KVO. We're gonna give him a low sodium diet. We're going to hold everything for his medications except clopridogrel and warfarin. And I'm going to give him a low sodium diet. And I'm going to give him a low dosage to help him be healthy. We're going to give him a low sodium diet. We're going to add in a dobutamine IV drip. And yeah, the unit IV drip, we're going to put him on a BiPAP. And we're going to get Pete for lab, we're going to get PT INR and serial troponins. We're transferring him to interventional cardiology for AICD and CRT, CRT D placement."
" Leslie Palmer is a 60-year-old man who presents with a shortness of breath and fatigue. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and AFib. He had a cabbage 12 years ago, as well as stents more recently. He takes a Cinepro, a Tarvastatin, Clopidogrel, Metformin, FirstMind, Metoprolol, Sulfate, and Warfarin. He eats a balanced diet, walks for exercise, and smokes one pack per day. He has a family history. His mother died of breast cancer. His father has Alzheimer's disease. He has no known drug allergies. He eats a balanced diet, walks for exercise, and smokes one pack per day.

" 64-year-old female presents with shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. Two weeks ago, she had an infection associated with a cough, cold, and fever, but it has now resolved. Now she's feeling pain in her chest, and her shortness of breath increases with exercise, and the shortness of breath is relieved by sitting. She's not been able to lay down because of her shortness of breath and that pain, so she's been sleeping in the chair for the past few weeks. Her review of systems shows that she has fatigue and gained eight pounds in the past two weeks. She has palpitations and chest pain. She experiences wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, and she has swelling in her legs. They are noropertinant findings in skin, hint, and neuro. So past medical history, she has been diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril-10-MG every day. She currently has no known drug allergies. Surgical history includes a cardiac cath a year ago. But other than that, no hospitalizations. Her family history shows her mother passed from breast cancer five years ago, and her father is currently living in a nursing home because he has dementia. Social history shows she has a balanced diet, exercises two times a week, but hasn't been able to because of her shortness of breath, doesn't do any illicit drugs, tobacco, or drinks alcohol. She drinks a cup of coffee a day. She is currently employed as an elementary school teacher and has a partner for 30 years. Who is her support system? So after conducting the physical exam, I found a positive JVD sign. Her PMI was displaced laterally by basilar rails, fetal edema, and with no chest wall tenderness, and her pulses in her extremities were 2+. Her vitals showed she had an elevated heart rate at around 110 beats per minute. Her O2 stat was at 91%, and her BP was slightly elevated at 130 over 90. Her lab value showed she had an elevated TRIPUS. and BNP levels. Her echo shows reduced ejection fraction with dilation of left ventricle. Her EKG shows a right bundle branch block and sinus tachycardia. Checks S-ray showed she had pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. After looking at all these values and conducting the physical exam and getting her history, I'm diagnosing her with myocarditis cardiomyopathy. A secondary diagnosis could be dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, but given her recent infection, a couple weeks ago, I am going to assume it is the myocarditis cardiomyopathy. So my plan for her right now is to admit her to telemetry and administer acetaminophen for the pain she's feeling, acetaminophen 625, and IV furosemide for the swelling in her legs, and keep her on that lisinopril. Nursing orders include strict IO, daily weight check, DVD prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula, and maintain her O2 stat greater than 96%. I'm going to talk to infectious disease, the cardiologist, and radiologist. I'm going to talk to the cardiologist to come up with a plan for this patient. This includes CRTD and AICD placement, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, immune globulin or glucocorticoids, and a medically enhanced MRI. Cause of her myocarditis is because of her recent infection that she's experienced two weeks ago, and she currently does have insurance because of her job, and her husband will be meeting her at the hospital."
" Good afternoon, Dr. Rollins. I saw Ms. Leslie today. She is a 62-year-old woman who presents to the office for a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, heart flutter, and palpitations. Ms. Leslie was in her usual state of excellent health until two months ago when she developed worsening shortness of breath and palpitations. She reports the symptoms being better at rest and when she's elevated and worse during physical activity. She does feel like passing out at times. She does not complain of radiating pain. Ms. Leslie does have a history of sarcoidosis, which she was diagnosed 25 years ago and is currently being treated for hypertension with lisinopril. Along with lisinopril, she reports taking prednisone as well. She has no known allergies. Her social history includes a balanced diet, limited exercise, no drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, and moderate caffeine use. She is an elementary school teacher. She is sexually active and in a relationship. Her past surgical history includes a cardiac cath about one year ago, and she has no prior hospitalizations. Her father died of a heart attack at 59, and her mother had a sudden death at 40. She appears awake, alert, oriented, fatigued, and presents with weight gain of about eight pounds and swollen ankles. Review of systems. Of her skin was negative. Review of systems of her musculoskeletal component was negative, and her blood pressure was elevated at 136 over 99, and her heart rate was also elevated at 110. Upon palpitation, edema was noted in her ankles. Lower extremity pulses were normal bilaterally. She did present with rails bilaterally and wheezing. She was negative for a common test and had no TART or spinal abnormalities. She was diagnosed with osteopathic screening. Her chest x-ray showed normal cardiac silhouette, mediastinal fullness, and pulmonary edema. Her BNP was elevated at 4,000. Troponin was at normal levels. Her EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a non-sustained left ventricle tachycardia. Her 2D echo showed increased wall thickness with an ejection fraction of 50%, and she was up to date with her immunizations. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, and she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, and she was admitted to telometry. In terms of medication, amiodarone, 150 mg, and furosemide, 40 mg IV was added, and prednisone was increased to 60 mg from 10 mg. She will be on a low-sodium diet and will be receiving out-of-bed assistance. CMP was ordered, and an interventional cardiology consult for AICD placement nuclear med consult for FDG PET was indicated. She will be continuing her lisinopo medication."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer, presented to the emergency department today with shortness of breath and fatigue. Claims it's been happening for the past six months, getting worse as the six months have progressed. Saw his family medicine doctor three weeks ago, or three days ago, excuse me, and they were giving some tests, told him they were going to talk about the tests in a few days. It got worse. He called him and said to come back to go to the ER. So he's here in the ER today. Says the symptoms have been, like I said, getting worse. They're worse when he lays down, the shortness of breath. So he's been sleeping in a chair the past few weeks, he says. There has been, he has a history of multiple stents placed at five in the past five years, I believe, and also an open heart surgery, a CABG, 12 years ago, 15 years ago. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia. Diabetes and was recently diagnosed with atrial fib. No drug allergies. Pack-a-day smoker for the past 30 years. No alcohol or drug use. He is employed as an elementary school teacher. Has insurance through his work and a married family support system. No relevant family medical history. Currently medicated on lisinopril, metoprolol, atarvastatin, metformin, furosemide, clopidogrel. He has been on warfarin, all for the previous diagnosis said before. Presented well-dressed, well-nourished, oriented. He was very oriented, just fatigued. Did not seem to be in any apparent pain. Review systems shown he had a JVD present, no carotid bruise. He had tachycardic with a split S2, heard on auscultation. No heart murmurs or gallops. Friction rubbed. He had a laterally displaced PMI on palpitation. Listening to lung sounds. He had rails were present. Also, like I said, orthopnea. Can't breathe while lying down. Shorter breath, dyspnea with exertion and wheezing. He also says the fatigue and shortness of breath is even on rest. So go into a class three heart failure. On his lab. As he came back. PTNIR was elevated and as well as troponin and BMP. 2D echo showed that he had a dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a left axis. Probably because of that cardiomegaly and that lateral PMI. Left bonal branch block and left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria was met. Chest X-ray shows DEMA. Cardiomegaly. So we went ahead and diagnosed him with ischemic. Cardiomyopathy. Excuse me. Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. I would reduce ejection fraction 30%. Administer him to the ICU. It's a serious condition. We're going to get his vitals checked for two hours. A strict eyes and nose, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis. I'm going to get him on a BiPAP 16 over six. 50%. Saline with KBO. Then a POS-VOLV is a current meds right now, except for the warfarin and clopidogrel. Go ahead and add a dobutamine drip because of that low blood pressure. And also his vitals showed a low blood pressure of 80 over 60. 80 over 50, excuse me, with a heart rate of 90. Oxygen stats 86%. So that's why we want to go ahead and get him on the BiPAP dobutamine for that low blood pressure. Also insulin stats. Keep track of those sugars. Keep him stable. Go ahead and order more serial troponins to check how he's doing as well as PT-INR since he's on that warfarin. With that AFib, we don't want any extra clotting to occur. From there, going to go ahead and give him an interventional cardiology consult potential for a CRTD and AICD placement. Other than that, he seemed present, happy. Just. Fatigue and trouble, so hopefully we'll get him taken care of. All right, thank you."
" Hello, Dr. Rollins. I'd like to present the case of Mr. Leslie Palmer. He is a 62-year-old male who presents today with shortness of breath and severe fatigue. This all started about six months ago, but has gotten worse in the last three days. He went to see his primary care physician and was instructed to come to the emergency department. He said he doesn't know any of the test results that he took at the primary care physician. The shortness of breath occurs even at rest, and he's forced to sleep in his recliner due to symptoms worsening when lying down. So he really doesn't feel good today, and it's been bad around the clock pretty much. From my review of systems, he said that he has fatigue, has gained eight pounds in the last week. He's experiencing wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Everything else was negative. His prior medical history, he does have hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and recent AFib. His past family history, his mother died at the age of 80 from breast cancer. His father is still alive, but in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. For his important surgical history, he did have a cabbage 12 years ago. He's had five stents in the last five years, with the last one being in his LED. His cardiologist has told him he is not able to get any more stents after this. And his most recent echo showed a 40% injection fraction. For his medications, he is treating his medical history. He is on lisinopril, 10 mg, atorvastatin, 10 mg, clopidogrel, 75 mg, metformin, 500 mg, furosemide, 20 mg, metoprol, sulcinate for 50 mg, and warfarin, 2.5 mg. He does not have any known drug allergies. As for his social history, he claims to eat a balanced diet. He used to go on walks daily, but due to his recent symptoms, has not been able to do so. He's been on medication for a long time, and he's been able to. He has been smoking for the last 30 years about a pack a day. He consumes caffeine, just one cup of coffee a day, no tobacco or alcohol. He is an elementary school teacher teaching fifth grade, and he is sexually active with his wife, who's also his social support system at home. His vital signs showed a temperature of 98.6, respiratory rate of 22, blood pressure of 80 over 50, and an SpO2 of 86%, which is a little low. His PMS was displaced laterally. He did have bivascular rales and wheezing and one plus pitting edema in his lower extremities. The negatives were there were no bruises, no regurgitations, no chest wall tenderness, no calf tenderness, and pulses were full and equal. Dorsalis p is pulse. My primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with, NYHA class four due to the symptoms being present at rest. My secondary diagnoses are hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. So my plan for this patient is to admit him to the ICU. His labs also showed elevated troponin and BNP, so I would like serial troponins taken. As for his other lab results, he did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension on chest x-ray. His EKG had a left bundle branch block and left axis, and his echo had a dilated left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction from his last one down to 30% this time. In the ICU, I would like him to be on strict bed rest, INOs, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. I am going to put him on BiPAP 16 over 6, a low-sodium diet, and put in an IV just to keep the vein open. As for meds, I am going to keep him on esclapitogrel and warfarin of 75 and 2.5 mgs respectively. I am going to add in IV dobutamine and put him on an insulin sliding scale. For his labs, as I said, I would like serial troponins, but I'm also going to get a PT-INR, and I am going to consult interventional radiology to put in a CRTD and AICD. I think with all of these combined, we can really get Mr. Palmer where he needs to be. Thank you so much. Thank you."
" Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old female who presents to the emergency department with complaints of palpitation, shortness of breath, and feeling fatigue progressively for the past two months. She states that she's going to pass out occasionally whenever she does any activity. She denies feeling any symptoms like these in the past. Her symptoms worsen with any activity, and especially when she's trying to lay down. She denies any radiation of the pain or any of her symptoms, and she rates her symptoms 7 out of 10 in terms of severity. She states that she followed up with her primary care physician three days ago and had blood work and imaging done at the same time. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She's currently on lisinopril 10 milligrams daily, as well as prednisone 10 milligrams daily. Her past surgical history is significant for cardiac catheterization that she had about one year ago, which was reportedly normal. She denies any tobacco use, alcohol use. She denies any drug use, and states that she has a balanced diet and tries to exercise every day. Her mother passed away from certain cardiac death at the age of 40, and her father passed away from myocardial infarction at the age of 59. Her reviews of system was positive for feeling fatigued, weight gain, palpitation, presyncope, dyspnea with exertion, orthopnea, wheezing, and lower extremity edema. Her vitals showed blood pressure of 136. Over 90, pulse of 110, respiration rate of 20, temperature of 98.6, oxygen saturation of 91, and heart rate of 110. Physical exam findings were significant for S4 murmur, Javier vein distension, bivasal arreals, wheezing, and pedal edema. However, dorsalis fetus pulse was full and equal on both sides. PMI was noted to be normal, and there were no carotid bruise noted. Labs showed BMP levels elevated at 4,000. However, troponin levels were normal. Chest x-ray findings showed normal cardiac celibate sign. However, it was noted to have widened mediastinum as well as pulmonary edema. 2D echo cardiogram showed that patient had restricted cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness as well as ejection fraction of 55%. EKG showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and normal sinus rhythm. And patient was noted. Patient was noted to have sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy based on all the labs and imaging findings and was advised to admit to telemetry. She was also started on amiodarone-150 milligrams IV as well as furosemide-50 milligrams IV dosage. Her prednisone dose was increased from 10 milligrams to 60 milligrams daily, and she was advised to continue rest of her medications. Ms. Palmer was also advised to consult with interventional cardiology for automatic implantable cardiovent. Cardioverter defibrillator as well as radiology for a pet scan. She was agreeable to all the consultation and management plan that was given to her."
" I saw earlier in the ED, Ms. Foster, she presented with a two-month history of chest flutters and dyspnea on exertion. She states that over the last three days, it's gotten worse. She saw her doctor who had ordered some lab tests, but when she called in and said things had gotten worse the last couple of days, they recommended that she go to the ED, so she presented today. She states that she's having to be sleeping in a chair due to orthopnea at night. She has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis. As far as her past medical history, she has a history of hypertension, which she takes lisinopril for, and she's also currently on 10 milligrams of prednisone for her sarcoidosis. Past surgical history includes cardiac cath that she sent went well. Last year, she was on a blood test, and she was on a blood test for her heart. Her family history on the other side, she said that her mother died at age 40 from sudden death. They weren't exactly sure it occurred, and her father is also deceased at age 59 from NMI. As far as her social history, she does not drink alcohol, does not use tobacco, does not use illicit drugs. She's a teacher for occupation. Diet is well-balanced. She does drink one cup of coffee a day. She states that she normally will exercise, like walking with her friends, but recently due to the inability of the shortest of breath upon exertion, she has no longer continued to walk with her friends. Living situation is stable. She has support at home. No known drug allergies. As doing her review of systems, she had some fatigue and some recent eight-pound weight gain in the last couple weeks. Her healthیh wasRA system was good. Something didn't work out, but then she did足 like probably eight pounds a day. Her heart apatiensh played a big captive part of her life from that and her neck went to the.. post Mas T Duncanvery FA eine region of scripture that she won an Amin d that she had had some dyspnea and orthopnea. She had some lower extremity edema, but otherwise no muscle aches or pains. Neuro, she had no confusion, dizziness, or gait disturbances that she had noticed. As far as I could tell, she was alert and oriented. She did have some fatigue. Vital signs were 136 over 99, heart rate of 110, and respirations of 20. SpO2 was at 91. When I further did an evaluation of the patient, she had a positive JVD, but no carotid bruit. Her heart rate was regular, but there was an S4 murmur noted, a positive gallop, and no regurge. She did have some peripheral edema, lung sounds. She had some bilateral bronchi with wheezing. After the physical exam, some x-rays and an echo along with an EKG were ordered. I interpreted at the patient's bedside those results. Her lab showed elevated BNP with normal troponin. Her EKG showed not sustained ventricular tachycardia with otherwise normal sinus rhythm. Her echocardiogram showed restriction in her cardiopathy. It showed restricted cardiopathy with normal sinus rhythm. Her ECG showed increased wall thickness, but the ejection fraction was still 55%. Upon reading her chart, examining the patient, and looking over her lab results and x-rays, I determined the patient most likely was having cardiomyopathy related to her sarcoidosis. I advised that the patient be admitted to telemetry, vitals every couple of hours. She can be admitted to a hospital every couple of hours. She can be admitted to a hospital every couple of hours. I advised that the patient be admitted to a hospital every couple of hours. She can be admitted to a hospital every couple of hours. I also recommended that we continue herbania offrequenzia to 60 milligrams, put her on IV flu laser for her pulmonary edema, I also recommended that we put her on IV flu accused seconds for the matter. I also recommended that we put her on IV flu��asemide for her pulmonary edema along with herブرtlency and his T romance of slavery and those background conditions.

And that's all I have."
" today. Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old man who presents to the office for the chief complaint of dyspnea with exertion and fatigue. Mr. Palmer is an elementary school teacher with a wife of 30 years. He was in his usual state of excellent health until two weeks ago prior to admission when he developed an acute onset of shortness of breath. He reports walking with his co-workers after work when he felt the symptoms before admission. He describes the symptoms to be generalized throughout his body with a constant duration during exertion. Exercise seems to make it worse. He does not complain of any radiating pain. He rates his pain as a 5 out of 6 on the scale of 0 to 10. Mr. Palmer has a history of high blood pressure, which he was diagnosed with hypertension and is currently being treated for this with lisinopril 10 milligrams. Along with the lisinopril, he does not report any over-the-counter herbal medications. Mr. Palmer does not report any allergies. His social history includes a high blood pressure, which he was diagnosed with hypertension, and is currently a balanced diet, regular exercise before the onset of symptoms two weeks ago, no drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, and regular caffeine consumption of one and a half cups of coffee every morning. He works as an elementary school teacher and is sexually active with his wife. He has a positive surgical history of a cardiac cath performed one year ago at his yearly physical. He has had no hospitalizations. His family history is positive for his family history and his family history is positive for his father passing away at age 59 from an MI and his mother passing away at age 40 from a sudden cardiac death. Today, Mr. Palmer appears awake, alert-oriented, and presents with no fatigue, fever, chills, weight loss, or weight gain. Review of symptoms of his skin was negative with no rash, bruising, lesions, or color changes, or warmth touch. Review of systems of his MSK was negative, no muscle, back, or joint pain. Review of pulmonary systems was positive for wheezing and dyspnea with exertion. Review of cardiovascular systems was positive for palpitations, near syncope, but no passing out, no full syncope, an S4 murmur, and a laterally displaced PMI. His vital signs seemed abnormal with an elevated BP of 130 over 90. Other vital signs were normal with a BPM of 110 and oxygen saturation of 96%. No carotid, bruise, or JVD were noted, no chest wall tenderness, auscultation, and palpation of the epigastric area, was a negative for no bruit or pulsatile mass. Lower extremity pulses were normal bilaterally, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, Hohmann sign was negative, and calves were symmetrical. OMM examination of the thoracic spine was normal with no notable tarch changes. Upon palpation, no lower extremity edema was noted. Review of labs ordered by the family physician three days ago showed cardiomegaly. On chest x-ray, troponin and BNP were within normal limits, and a 2D echo performed showed an asymmetrical left ventricle with an enlarged interventricular septum and an ejection fraction of 60%. Today, Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with familial hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and is in serious condition. I counseled Mr. Palmer to be admitted to telemetry and to check vitals Q2 hours. He was counseled for activity at the hospital, and he was diagnosed with a and a regular diet. Lecidinib pro 10 mg was discontinued, and disoperamide 100 mg QID was instead started. Referrals to interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgery for possible septal myomectomy and alcohol injection were counseled. Thank you."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension and presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and a presyncope episode two weeks ago while walking. The associated episode was with dyspnea that was aggravated while walking and any kind of physical activity, but was relieved with rest. Therefore, he falls under the New York Heart Association classification of two. The patient also described wheezing as well as rasping and fluttering that last for the duration of any kind of exertion. The patient described there was no history of cough, chest pain, no weight loss or fever, chills or sweats. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease include a positive family history of an MI on the father's side that passed away at 69 years old and a maternal medical condition. The patient also described a surgical history of sudden cardiac death. Currently, the patient is taking lisinopril for their hypertension and has no known drug allergies. They did have a surgical history of a heart cath. And as for their social history, they have a balanced diet and were very active exercising. But as of now, they have shortness of breath while walking. It's a moderate consumption use of caffeine. And no... consumption of tobacco, alcohol or drugs. They are an elementary... sorry, they are a middle school teacher that lives with their husband. So as for their vital signs, the patient has vitals of blood pressure of 130 over 90, temperature of 98.6, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, and a saturated blood pressure of 80.2. And as for their social history, they have a balanced diet and were very active exercising. They have a variation of oxygen of 91%. And they appear to wake alert and oriented. I performed a cardiopulmonary physical exam that indicated no carotid bruise and did have a jugular venous distension. They had a regular heart rate, no murmurs, friction, rug, or gallops present, but a laterally displaced PMI. As for respiratory, he had no chest wall tenderness, but wheezes were present with no respiratory problems. They had respiratory distress. In their extremities, their pulses were full and equal with non-tender calves and no pedoedema. I reviewed imaging of a Chex X-ray that indicated cardiomegaly, as well as an echo that indicated left ventricular asymmetry with hypertrophy and an injection fraction of 60%. And their EKG read to be a normal sign for them, with a left ventricular hypertrophy criteria and tall R-wave in the septal leads. Their labs came back showing their troponin and BMP levels was not elevated. Therefore, my assessment for this patient is that they have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, secondary to their hypertension. And this is because of the family history of sudden cardiac death and normal cardiovascular markers. And their labs. That's why I'd like to admit this patient to telemetry for a serious condition and checking their vitals every two hours and indicated activity as tolerated with nursing interventions of daily weights, strict IOs, a nasal cannula oxygen, maintaining their oxygen saturation above 96% and DVT prophylaxis, keeping them on a low sodium diet and IV fluid orders for keeping the veins open. No pain medications, but I would like to add disoperamide, 100 milligrams per oral and discontinue the lisinopril in order to manage any dysrhythmia that they are experiencing. No labs are needed to be ordered as well as non-imaging, but refer and for consult to interventional cardiologists for an AICD placement defibrillator, as well as cardiothoracic surgery consult for a septal myectomy. And I would like to add a few more things. I would like to add a few more things. for the inflammation and management of the hypertrophy. Thank you."
" 62-year-old female named Leslie Palmer. She reported to me today with a history of shortness of breath and fatigue. So the shortness of breath and the fatigue have been progressively worsening over the past six months. And at her visit today, she had reported that the shortness of breath was occurring even at rest. So any sort of physical activity, even just walking down the hall, she reported shortness of breath. And she is having to sleep in a chair for that reason at night. So she did have a positive orthopnea. And again, it is at rest and with physical activity. So additionally, she's been in the past two weeks, she reported that she's gained about eight pounds. And getting into some of her medical history, she does have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia. Diabetes and atrial fibrillation. Surgically, she has a history of about 12 years ago, she had a triple bypass surgery. She's also had five stents placed in total. And they did inform her that she's not a candidate for further stents. She was informed by a previous physician that her ejection fraction was about 40%. Getting into some of her medications, she provided me with a list. She was on a good number of medications. To name them, she was on lisinopril, metformin, warfarin, metoprolisuchinate. She was on furosemide. And so that's it for the medications. She did not have any drug allergies. Some of her social history, she has a good balanced diet. She did report that she is actually able to walk daily, even though she did state that she is experiencing shortness of breath. She did report that she is able to walk daily, even though she did state that she is experiencing shortness of breath. With any physical activity, she still was making the effort to walk every day, which is very good. And she does not report any use of illicit medications or over-the-counter medications other than what's prescribed to her. She does have a 30-pack year history, I'm sorry, 30-year history of smoking, for which she has been smoking one pack per day. No alcohol consumption. And she has been drinking about one cup of coffee every day. As far as her sexual activity, she is married, is in a monogamous relationship, and for her living situation, she is living with her husband. So getting into some of her vitals, her blood pressure was significantly low at 80 over 50. Her pulse at about 90, and her oxygen also low at about 86. And her respiration rate was a little bit elevated at 22. And I did discuss that with her and talk about what was standing out in regards to her blood pressure. And I did discuss that with her and talk about what was standing out in regards to her blood pressure. So getting into her physical exam, she did have positive jugular venous distension. However, she did not have any carotid bruit. She did have some swelling in her calves. So she was positive for lower extremity edema. However, her Hohmann's sign was negative. So getting into her lab work. So troponin and BMP, were both elevated. INR was not elevated. Her echo was showing she had a reduced ejection fraction of about 30%. So she had reported in the past that the physician told her it was about 40. And today it was 30. So it possibly could have gone down. Her EKG was showing a left bundle branch block. And so using those findings, I, my diagnosis was a schematology. Um, and then there are more enfin�� relieve pel bear developped. I went to your lab with thevestическая and I was able to tell you that her blood pressure was 20 and not 10, a 40 F . So the they metantly brought down to 30. And the homesickness was no longer. And so my model at stepinc perhaps kind of SAFE says that. for an expert says that her blood pressure was 46 точки, Paralimetry was 49. I between squad versus Muse curve starts to increase her blood pressure, especially her hemical germ höher. So which means that she had your adolescent time to assigned the completamente.中 arbiter Av español constSee how . her blood pressure as it is quite low. It was quite low. But once she returned home her medicated. to to Whitaker, my friends, she thought to me that. because of her lab work and because of her symptoms, I just wanted to make sure that she could be continuously monitored, monitored, taking, taking good care of. So other than that, that would be my encounter. Thank you very much for listening. Bye."
" So, Ms. Leslie is a 62-year-old female presenting with dyspnea, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and a history of progressively worsening symptoms of palpitations and these troubles breathing. This has been going on for the past two months when she went and finally decided to see her family doctor three days ago to address these symptoms. The family doctor sent her away, and then she called the family doctor today, and they told her to go and visit the emergency department. Ms. Leslie has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Upon arriving, her vitals were taken, and she had a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 136 over 99, and a SpO2 of 9B1. Her familial history is significant for sudden death of her mother at 40 and father dying of a heart attack at 59. She has no known drug allergies. She's currently on the centiparal and prednisone, as well as having no substantial social history other than living with her husband and moderate caffeine usage. Ms. Leslie used to... exercise fairly frequently until the past two months where she's been bedridden. Ms. Leslie sleeps in a chair now because of her orthopnea, so it's easier for her to breathe in a recliner, so that's where she sleeps. And she has an NYHA scale of heart rating of 3, as she has issues with any sort of non-resting activity. Upon that, upon diagnosis... Upon... uh... focused physical exam and diagnostic findings, we determined that Ms. Leslie, we believe she has pulmonary... uh... not pulmonary... sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy. We saw that with an x-ray that had... pathognomonic... QR lymph node findings, as well as diffuse infiltrates within the lungs and enlarged heart. And... yes. Ms. Leslie will be... admitted to the hospital in serious condition. She will receive 2 liters of O2 via nasal cannula, as well as increasing her prednisone, keeping her own lisinopril, as well as adding imiodarone and furosemide to relieve edema that she has from a buildup of water in her legs. Or a buildup of fluid in her legs. Furthermore, we consulted radiology for an FDG PET scan, as well as interventional cardiology for a... AICD automatic cardiac defibrillator in her heart. Ms. Leslie was put on a low-salt diet with an IV to keep open, as well as... Leave that mic. During our physical exam, Ms. Leslie did have... abnormal cardiac findings, including a murmur and a gallop at S4. By basilar arousal. And that... is it. So once again, we admitted her to the hospital. And... we started treatment with... furosemide, prednisone, continued lisinopril, and imiodarone to... treat a... paroxysmal ventricular... tachycardia. With that..."
" Hello, Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male who presented today with dyspnea and fatigue after being referred to us by his family doctor. He noticed fatigue and dyspnea while walking two weeks ago, although he states that it is better with rest and better with laying down. The dyspnea and fatigue became worse last night, and he also reports a history of presyncope, palpitations, and wheezing. He has a medical history of hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril, and he takes no other medications. He has no allergies. He had a cardiac cath years ago, which came back normal, and he also has a family medical history of sudden death in his mother at 40. His father died of an MI in his 50s. He is an elementary school teacher who drinks one cup of coffee a day, no alcohol, no tobacco, and eats a balanced diet, and he enjoys going for walks every day, although he has been unable to do this recently due to the dyspnea and fatigue. Okay. For his vitals, I noticed a heart rate of 110, oxygen saturation of 96, blood pressure of 130 over 90, and a respiratory rate of 16, and a temperature of 98. On physical exam, I noted a crescendo-decrescendo murmur and a displaced PMI, which I discussed with the patient. For his imaging, on the x-ray, we saw a cardiomyopathy, a cardiomegaly. On the echo, we saw hypertrophy of the septum. And on the EKG, we showed septal hypertrophy with increased amplitude waves in the leads V1, V2, and V3. So the diagnosis, which I think is most likely for his case, is familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which I discussed with the patient, and I prescribed disopiramide for him, discontinued his lisinopril. I also referred him to an intravenous. I also referred him to an intravenous cardiologist, which I discussed with the patient, and a cardiovascular surgeon. Thank you."
" Leslie presents today as a female patient for an evaluation of her shortness of breath, feeling like she's going to pass out, and heart palpitations. She states she can't do anything. She reports this began two months ago and has worsened over the past three days. She was referred here today by her family medicine doctor who saw her three days ago. She notes fatigue and 8-pound weight gain over the past week, lower extremity edema, significant palpitations over the past two months, as well as wheezing and orthopnea over the past two months. Her past medical history includes hypertension and the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She currently takes lisinopril for the hypertension and prednisone for her recent medical issues. The patient currently lives with her husband, who she describes as her social support, and she does have insurance. She currently works as an elementary school teacher. Prior to two months ago, she was an active one. She states due to her symptoms, she is not able to do that now. The patient reports a healthy diet. She reports tachycardia. On the exam today, she had tachycardia at a heart rate of 110 and SpO2 less than 95, hypertension at blood pressure 136 over 99, and a respiratory rate of 20. She was positive for jugular venous distension, negative for carotid brutes, systolic S4 present, gallic present. Negative rubs, rails bilaterally, positive wheezing, plus one pitting edema. She had a bilateral lower extremity pulse and non-tender calves. In summation, with the patient's history of sarcoidosis with positive exam findings, as well as pawnbroker sign and pulmonary edema on anterior-posterior views on radiograph, an echocardiogram displaying restrictive cardiomyopathy with heart failure with preserved heart ejection fraction, normal sinus rhythm with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, an electrocardiogram, negative troponin, and a brain natripeptide of 4000, she has a diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Today, I stated that she was in New York Heart Association level four, and this is a serious condition. So given these findings and her diagnosis, she will go to the hospital. She will go to telemetry to be continued to be evaluated. And I will consult with an interventional cardiologist as well as a nuclear medicine or radiologist for further workup. She will continue lisinopril 10 milligrams every day. Amyota run 150 milligrams intravenously. Herd in his own will be increased to 60 milligrams every day. And for us, I'm I'd 40 milligrams intravenously repeat vitals will be taken every two hours. And if she decides to get. Get out of bed, she will need assistance. And that is my case presentation for Leslie. Thank you."
" Presenting with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue, her symptoms began six months ago and she visited her PCP three days ago. She reports that she cannot catch her breath, but states that there is no accompanying chest pain. She describes orthopnea, in which reclining improves her symptoms and her symptoms worsen with activity. In terms of Leslie Palmer's past medical history, she has reported atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and her immunizations are up to date. In terms of past surgical history, she reports a previous cardiac stent. In fact, there have been five cardiac stents and she's no longer a candidate for any future ones. And she has also undergone a bypass graft or a CABG. In terms of her maternal family history, her mother has passed due to breast cancer and her father is, alive but is suffering from Alzheimer's. In terms of her social history, she reports no alcohol use, tobacco use active, about a pack per day, and no illicit drug use. She's currently employed. Her diet is regular and balanced. She reports one cup per day in terms of caffeine. She exercises regularly prior to having these symptoms. Now she can no longer exercise. And she lives with her husband. In terms of medications, she takes atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. And in terms of drug allergies, she has no known drug allergies. When assessing her ROS, she does suffer from fatigue. She reports weight gain. There have been no skin abnormalities. And when it comes to HEANT, there are also no abnormalities. And when assessing her chest, she reported no chest pain, no palpitations. They were all negative. When it comes to her lungs, she reports wheezing. Again, orthopnea as described and dyspnea. When it comes to musculature, she does have lower extremity edema. And in terms of her neurological examination, there was nothing, it was all negative. Her vital signs were a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90, a rather high respiratory rate at 22, a low blood pressure hypotension at 80 over 50, and her SpO2 was also at 86, which was low. When assessing her neck, there was JVD present. And when assessing her heart during the physical exam, we noticed no murmur. And her PMI was displaced. And there was some tachycardia as well. When listening to her lung sounds, we found there was both wheezing and rails. In terms of her extremities, we found pedal edema and decreased pulses. And in terms of imaging, she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on the chest x-ray. When we assessed her 2D echo, we found that there was a left ventricular ejection, fracture of less than 30%. And in terms of imaging, when it came to the EKG, we found normal sinus rhythm at 90. There was a left bundle branch block, and there was also criteria that met left ventricular hypertrophy. Her troponin levels were elevated, and her BNP was at 4000. I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated, colorectal, and parasympathetic. Her BNP was at 4000. I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated, colorectal, and parasympathetic. Her BNP was at 4000. I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated, cardiomyopathy, based off of her lab values and her patient history. Her NYHA classification would put her at a level of four, where she cannot carry on physical activity due to her symptoms. And the plan would be to admit her to the ICU, because her condition is serious. This would necessitate checking her vitals every two hours, as well as strict bed rest. And when it comes to the nurse, it requires a strict intake and outflow monitoring, as well as a daily weight monitoring, and also DVT prophylaxis in case her symptoms cause a clot or an embolus. In terms of her diet, we would prefer her to be low sodium. In IV fluids, we should keep the vein open. In terms of medication, there is no necessity for pain meds. However, for cardiovascular, we would prefer her to be low sodium. In terms of vasculature, we should prescribe clopidogrel, warfarin, and dobutamine. There is no need for diuretics at this moment. And because this is a diabetic patient, it would be best to put her on the insulin sliding scale. And again, based off of her oxygen saturation and her increased respiratory rate, I decided to put her on BiPAP. In terms of diagnostic lab orders, PT and INR, because of the warfarin, and serotroponins, to see if there's any change in her heart status. And then there is no need for any new imaging at this point. However, in terms of consultations, I did recommend an interventional cardiologist. This would be for both an AICD placement as well as a CRTD placement, which could deliver a shock as needed. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you."
" So, my patient is Leslie Palmer, who's a 62-year-old female whose chief complaint is shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient's shortness of breath began about two months ago and has been getting worse. Patient describes feeling fluttering in her chest and like she's going to pass out. Three days ago, the patient presented to her primary care physician where they ordered tests, and her primary care physician then recommended for her to go to the emergency room. The patient states that her symptoms get worse with activity and are better at rest. The patient is currently sleeping in a recliner at night because laying down makes her symptoms worse. On a scale of 0 to 10, the patient describes the severity of her discomfort as a 7 or an 8. As far as her social history goes, the patient has a balanced diet and walks every day prior to experiencing symptoms. She drinks a cup of coffee every day and is an elementary school teacher who lives with her husband. As far as her past medical history goes, she was diagnosed with hypertension. She was diagnosed with hypertension 15 years ago and pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago. She is up-to-date on immunizations and has no hospitalizations and no allergies. As far as surgery goes, she had a cardiac catheter one year ago that was found to have no obstructive coronary artery disease present. For her medication, she's currently on lisinopril 10 mg once a day for hypertension, and then her prednisone 10 mg once a day for pulmonary sarcoidosis. The patient states that she's compliant with these medications. It began with lisinopril 15 years ago. As far as her family history goes, the patient's mother passed away at the age of 40 due to sudden death, and her father passed at age 59 due to a myocardial infarction. As far as pertinent review of system goes, the patient has experienced fatigue, weight gain of 8 pounds over two weeks, swelling in lower extremities, near syncope, palpations, wheezing, dyspnea with exertion, and orthopenia. As far as pertinent physical exam, the patient has a positive jugular. As far as weight, the patient was fine and she had no forgetfulבנ теismic tumor. For the patient, side effects of WTI in particularLD, DDSs, stress homopathy were mainly un persistently28, frequent&dead, ect., 19 Coronary Arthroplasty, Brady's Injury Review, etc, and the protectorcy of S4 was testing her proximate at her yo vomit colitis reflexes, STD of 91% and a blood pressure of 136 over 99. For her results of her lab and imaging, her lab work shows that she has an elevated PMP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly, mediastinal fullness, as well as pulmonary edema. Her echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, normal access, non-sustained ventricular, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. My leading differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association rating of three. As far as the cause goes, I explained the patient that most likely this is due to the pulmonary sarcoidosis that went to her heart and resulted in arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. As far as assessment and plan goes, I am admitting the patient to telepathy. Sorry. Condition is serious. Allergies none. Vitals every two hours. She can be out of bed with assistance. As far as nursing interventions go, this would include strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, O2 via nasal cannula, as well as maintaining oxygen saturation greater than 96%. A diet of low sodium is also recommended, as well as for IV fluids, a saline lock, and keeping the vein open. As far as medications go, I recommend continuing lisinopril. I recommend taking a lot of medication, including a lot of medication, including a lot of medication, including a lot of as well as nuclear medicine and radiologists to discuss an FDG PET scan. As far as lifestyle modifications, I recommended to her focusing on a healthy diet, weight reduction, and physical activity when she's cleared by the physician. The patient had no further questions, and I went ahead and let her know that her husband could come up, and I would explain the information to him. Thank you."
" where I'm with Ms. Palmer, a 62-year-old female who presents today with shortness of breath and chest pain. Ms. Palmer states that her primary care doctor sent her to the ER after he evaluated her for her symptoms. Two weeks ago, Ms. Palmer had a fever and a cough and has had progressive symptoms since then. She states that her chest pain is currently 2 out of 10. Her shortness of breath is worse with exertion and supine. The patient is alert and oriented, is not febrile today, and 98.6 is her temperature. Her blood pressure is slightly elevated at 130 over 90. She's tachycardic at 110, and her stats are at 91% on room air. Ms. Palmer has hypertension, as her medical history, and she currently takes lisinopril 10 mg every day. She has had a cardiac cath done one year ago, but has no noted obstructive coronary artery disease. She does not have any allergies, and concerned to her lifestyle, she's currently a second grade teacher and reportable. She reports that she exercises twice a week when she feels well. She reports no alcohol, tobacco, or drug use. She has a father with Alzheimer's, a mother who died at 80 from breast cancer. In reviewing her systems, Ms. Palmer reported recent weight gain of 8 pounds, edema in her ankles. She also noted palpitations, chest pain, and wheezing, and was positive for both dyspnea and orthopnea. On physical exam, Ms. Palmer noted JVD and pitting edema. I did note a left displaced PMI and no carotid or epigastric bruise or murmurs. Rails and wheezing were noted bilaterally on lung cells. I ordered a chest x-ray echo labs and an EKG on chest x-ray. I noted cardiomegaly and diffused bilateral pulmonary edema. Her echo indicated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction under 30%, and she had an elevated troponin and BNP. Her EKG indicated tachycardia, left axis deviation, PVCs, and a right bundle branch block. Because of her negative cath one year ago and lack of comorbidities, I rolled out coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease, and her family history rolls out sarcoidosis. Due to her recent fever, my primary diagnosis is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA class II heart failure. Her condition is serious, and I will have her vitals monitored every two hours. I'm going to admit her to telemetry, and I will allow activity as tolerated with a strict INO, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and begin oxygen by nasal cannula in 96 until she gets to 96 immediately. I am going to keep her on low sodium and low sodium. I am going to keep her on low sodium and low sodium, and I will allow activity as tolerated with a strict INO, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and begin oxygen by nasal cannula in 96 until she gets to 97 immediately. I am going to keep her on low sodium and low sodium, and I will allow activity as tolerated with an IV, but I will hold fluids, and I will reorder a trope and a CMP. I plan to continue her lisinopril of 10 mg, acetaminophen at 625 for pain, rosamide of 40 by IV, and I will consult interventional cardiology due to the possible need for CRT and AIC placement and endocardial biopsy, infectious disease, and also the radiologist for MRI to detect myocardial inflammation. Let me know if you need anything, and thank you. Thank you."
" She's a two-year-old female elementary school teacher who presented today with a two-month history of shortness of breath and fatigue. She has also been experiencing palpitations and presyncope and was referred to us after visiting her primary care physician. Her vital signs are a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 136 over 99, respiratory rate is 20, O2 saturation is 92%, and temperature is 98.6. She has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis, which is taking 10 milligrams of lisinopril and 10 milligrams of prednisone. She has had a previous cardiac catheterization with no signs of obstructive coronary artery disease. Her family history includes the sudden death of her mother at 40 years old and the death of her father at 59 from a myocardial infarction. Her diet is fairly balanced. She used to exercise regularly until she starts experiencing the shortness of breath. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or any illicit drugs, and her caffeine intake is one cup a day, one cup of coffee. She has experienced an eight-pound weight gain over the past few weeks, along with orthotonia and swelling in her legs. I admitted her for continued cardiac monitoring with daily checks or daily weighting. I also did weight checks, oxygen, and for that to be maintained over a 96% saturation and DVT prophylaxis. I increased her dosage of prednisone and kept her lisinopril dosage the same. She will remain on a low-sodium diet and is allowed activity or movement with assistance. I added 150 milligrams of amiodarone and 40 milligrams of furosemide to help with the swelling and ordered a CMP to monitor her potassium levels. I've also gotten consultations to interventional cardiology for an AICD placement, as well as radiology for an FDG PET scan."
" seeing Mr. Leslie Palmer, who's a 62-year-old male who presents today with a complaint of dyspnea, fatigue, and intermittent palpitation that he's been experiencing for the past couple weeks. He states he's also been experiencing presyncope episodes, but has not had any syncopatic episodes to date. He states that he experiences the symptoms when he does moderate activities and is unable to do them without experiencing dyspnea, and he has to rest, or especially laying down helps to relieve his symptoms. He has a history of hypertension, which is controlled with a Cinephil 10 milligrams daily. He reports that he's tolerating the medication well. Mr. Palmer has a positive history for sudden cardiac, or sudden unexpected death. His mother died at age 40 unexpectedly, and his father died at age 59 due to myocardial infarction. He states he's never been in the hospital before, but has had a cardiac catheterization one year ago because his PCP wanted to investigate abnormal EKG findings. The results for the cardiac catheterization was indeed normal, though. He has no known drug allergies. He's a currently elementary school teacher. He would walk daily with his friends before experiencing symptoms or exercise. He denies any alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, and just has a morning cup of coffee. His review of symptoms was, positive for wheezing, also obviously palpitations, presyncope. It was negative for any lower extremity edema or chest pain in the musculoskeletal. The neurological review of symptoms were unremarkable. His vitals showed a blood pressure of 130 over 90, oxygen saturation at 96%, heart rate at 110, respiratory rate was 16, and temperature was 98.6. Physical exam revealed no JVD, no carotid or abdominal bruise. There was a positive systolic murmur in S4, as well as a gallop. No friction rub. The PMI was displaced laterally. The patient had no chest tenderness, and their lungs were cleared of auscultation bilaterally. The distal, excuse me, the dorsalis pedis and tibialis posterior pulses were equal in the chest. The catheter non-tenderal Hohmann sign was negative. No signs of lower extremity edema. Yeah, chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly. BMP and troponin labs were normal and unremarkable. 2D echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy, usual atrial enlargement. The, sorry, the EKG revealed, um, left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria, as well as tall R waves in the septal leads, suggestive of intraventricular septal hypertrophy and left ventricular hypertrophy. Sinus rhythm, normal sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats per minute was, uh, was the EKG. Excuse me. Um, yeah, and so with all of this, uh, in mind, I believe Mr. Palmer has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I, uh, recommended him that we should, uh, also be New York Heart Association stage two. Uh, I'd recommend it to be, uh, admitted to the hospital to telemetry. Um, so it's condition serious, good vitals every two hours, strict ISO, strict IO, uh, daily weight, um, nasal cannula, oxygen delivery to maintain oxygen saturation, 96%. Diagnostic normal activity as tolerated. This discontinues as the center pill 10 milligrams daily and replace it with discipline. So pure my 100 milligrams four times a day. Um, we'll do, uh, IV lock, uh, saline lock, keep the veins open and, um, no labs or other imaging is warranted at this point, but do, uh, consult to the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible septal myomectomy as well, or, um, alcohol injection to reduce the obstructive of the offload track obstruction. The outflow track are, um, and also to the interventional cardiologist to, um, for a possible AICD placement. With that alone, I think, uh, yeah, Mr. Paul is, uh, ready to see you. Okay. Hopefully that's it. And, uh, yeah."
" who reported to the ED this morning. She's a 62-year-old female with a cheek complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and dull chest pain. She presented to her family medicine physician three days ago to be evaluated. She says she had a cold two weeks ago consisting of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and fatigue. The symptoms went away five days ago but returned and now she feels worse than before. She continued to go to the gym while she was sick but stopped when her symptoms came back. She noticed that she sleeps in a chair at night because it helps her breathe better. She knows she is comfortable at rest but has dyspnea on exertion and with some exercise and orthopnea. This places her at a New York Heart Association classification of class two. Her past medical history includes hypertension which she takes lisinobril 10 milligrams daily for. She has no known drug allergies. Her past surgical history includes cardiac catheter one year ago that showed no abnormalities. Her mother passed away five years ago due to breast cancer and her father is currently living with Alzheimer's. She eats a healthy and well-balanced diet and before the symptoms started she exercised two to three times a week. She denies any illicit drug use, alcohol, and any illicit drug use, use of tobacco products, and consumption of alcohol. She drinks one cup of coffee daily and she's a third-grade teacher. She's a third-grade teacher and she's a third-grade teacher and she's not being updated on her immunizations and having insurance. Her review symptoms was positive for fatigue, weight gain of eight pounds over the past two weeks, chest palpitations, dull aching chest pain, wheezing, myalgia, and lower chimney edema. Her physical exams revealed JVD, fibasor rails, PMI displaced laterally, one plus pinning edema, and her lower chimney is a normal radial dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Her labs demonstrated elevated troponin at 0.10 and BNP at 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Her echo demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. Her EKG indicated sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, left axis deviation, and pre-ventricular contractions. Her vitals showed temperature of 98.5, 6, elevated heart rate of 110, elevated respiratory rate of 20, elevated blood pressure of 130 over 90, and her O2 was slightly decreased at 91 percent. So based on her history, exam findings, and the diagnostic workups, I believe that Ms. Palmer has a myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association, class 2, which is serious condition. I think the best plan of action would be to admit her to telemetry. To monitor her vitals every two hours, she can proceed with activity as tolerated, and she would be monitored by nursing for strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula to maintain O2 stats greater than 96 percent, and her saline fluid should be KVO, and her diet should be low sodium and food restriction. I believe a 2-day echo should be repeated. She should continue her lysinophil test for a few days, and she should be in a state of recovery within a few weeks. Her liver acidity should be saved to a minimum of 10 percent. She will be able to get a blood test done every two weeks. Her heart rate measured at 11.5. Her heart rate should be at 11.5. Her milligrams daily and begin, or she should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and begin furosemide 40 milligrams IV over 12 hours and acetaminophen 625 milligrams every six hours. ACMP and serial troponin should be ordered. A consult with interventional cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology should be conducted to place an AICD and CRTD. And an endomyocardial biopsy should also be completed. A media-enhanced MRI should be completed, and her immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids should be evaluated. And that is the end of my case presentation. Thank you for your time. Thank you."
" Thank you. Mrs. Palmer is a 62 year old woman who presented to the emergency department today with shortness of breath and fatigue. She was in her normal state of good health until about two weeks ago when she developed a cough, chest pain, rhinorrhea and fever, which she described as a cold. Five days ago, she noticed that while all of her other symptoms had resolved, her chest pain, fatigue and shortness of breath had actually gotten worse. So three days ago, she saw her family medicine doctor who recommended today that she come to the emergency department as the chest pain has continued to worsen. She has hypertension for what she's been taking with Cinepril 10 milligrams for 10 years and a cardiac catheter one year ago following an abnormal EKG showed no coronary artery disease. Her review of systems reveals fatigue, eight pound weight. Weight gain in two weeks, palpitations, chest pain, wheezing, orthopnea, dyspnea and lower leg myalgia and edema. Vitals show a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, a respiratory rate of 20 and an SpO2 of 91% on room air. She was previously able to go to the gym twice a week, which she is now unable to do without symptoms, which points me to NYHA class two. Physical. Exam showed JVD, laterally displaced PMI, bi-basilar rails and wheezing, as well as point plus one lower extremity edema with equal dorsalis, pedis pulses and non-tender calves. She had no cardiac bruise. The lab showed troponin elevated at 0.1 and BMP elevated at 4,000. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. A 2D echo showed ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of less than 30. And an EKG showed a right bundle branch block. And sinus tachycardia. My leading differential diagnosis is myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy in the New York Health Association class two, heart association class two. I think it's best if we admit her to telemetry and consult interventional cardiology for an AICD or a CRTD. Infectious disease for immunoglobulin and an endomyocardial biopsy and radiology for immediate enhanced MRI. I would like to start her on IV furosemide 40. 625 acetaminophen PO and continue the 10 milligrams of lisinopril as well as put her on a nasal cannula for O2 to get those stats above 96%. This patient would benefit from a low sodium diet with oral restrictions, strict intake outtake, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis and vitals every two hours. I walked this patient through these results and our plan and she had no further questions. As she expected however our client was mujer Vex, dr. We were informative and she awoke healthy and I heard a response very easily and I was veryORY INC sleep.

" Mr. Palmer today. So Mr. Palmer presented with a complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue that had been ongoing for the past six months. He said that this was kind of just mild for six months, and then over the last three days, it started progressively worsening. So he went to his primary care physician who ordered a few tests, which he was not sure of the name of. However, when his symptoms significantly worsened today, he called his PCP again, who referred him to the emergency department. The patient stated that his shortness of breath is worse with lying flat and with any type of exertion at all, such as just walking around, and he feels a little bit better when he lays back on an incline. When I walked in the room, his vitals showed a blood pressure of 80 over 50 with an SpO2 of 86 and a heart rate of about 20. He said that he was feeling a little bit more comfortable with his body and his body was feeling a little bit more comfortable with his body. So he was feeling a little bit more of 90 beats per minute. His past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease with a coronary artery bypass graph times three 12 years ago with an additional stent placed more recently. He remembers having an echo done that showed an EF of about 40% a few years ago. He's currently smoking one pack per day and lives at home with his wife. On exam, he had positive jugular venous distension. He was tachycardic with a split S2 and had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His PMI was displaced laterally and he had one plus lower extremity edema with no associated calf tenderness. After reviewing his results, we discussed that his chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. His EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis deviation and a left bundle branch block. And his labs showed elevated troponin and a BNP significant increase in the blood pressure. He was also diagnosed with a pulmonary edema with a dilated left ventricle. His most recent echo that he had done with us showed an ejection fraction of 30% and a dilated left ventricle. Given this, I diagnosed Mr. Palmer with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with plan to admit him to the ICU, reorder his PT INR and serial troponins, and I kept him on clopidogrel, warfarin, lisinopril, and started him on dobutamine as a positive ionotropic agent. I also told him that the interventional cardiologist would be coming by to consult and do the test. He was also diagnosed with a pulmonary edema with a dilated left ventricle.

" I just saw 62-year-old male Leslie Palmer with the chief complaint of six months of fatigue and shortness of breath that has gotten worse in the past two weeks, which prompted a visit to his primary care provider. He explains that he has been sleeping in a recliner due to increased shortness of breath while lying down and that he has the symptoms with all physical activity. His past medical history includes AFib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, surgical history of CABG, and biocardiac stents, to which his cardiologist has recommended no further intervention. Current medications include torvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin, with no known drug allergies. Upon review of his symptoms, significant findings include fatigue, weight gain of eight pounds in the last two weeks for an unknown cause, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema. Vitals, temp was normal, heart rate was normal, and respiratory rate was normal, but the patient was hypotensive with a BP of 80 over 50 and SpO2 of 86%. Upon physical exam, JVD1. JVD2 was present. Gallup was present with split S2 and tachycardia, as well as PMI displaced laterally. There was no respiratory distress or chest wall tenderness, but rails and wheezing were present. Extremities. Calves were non-tender, but pedal edema was present. Upon imaging, chest x-rays showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and LVH criteria. Troponin and BMP were elevated. My primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA functional classification of 4. I would like to admit this patient to the ICU with serious condition. Vitals check every two hours with strict bed rest, strict IO, daily weights, and DVT prophylaxis, as well as a low-sodium diet and KVT. Biofluids. I would like to hold his medications except for clopidogrel and warfarin, and I'd like to add dobutamine IV and insulin sliding scale. I'd also like to put him on BiPAP to raise that O2 and order PTINR and serial troponins. I'd also like to visit an interventional cardiologist for possible AICD placement and CRTD placement. Thank you."
" I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Palmer in the emergency department. Ms. Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting in the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. Her vitals demonstrated elevated heart rate at 110 and a low O2 saturation at 91%. She states that she has had trouble breathing over the past three days, and she also reports that she had a cold two weeks ago, including a fever, a sniffle, and some sneezing. She states that her current symptoms are better when she is in her recliner, so she has been sleeping in her recliner at night to help with these symptoms. When she lays flat, her symptoms are worse, and her symptoms also worsen with some daily activities. Which would put her at an NYHA classification of class 2. Her other pertinent medical history includes a 10-year history of hypertension, which is well-managed on lisinopril, 10 milligrams by mouth daily. She has no allergies to medications and no history of illicit drug use, no history of alcohol use, and no history of tobacco use. She eats a balanced diet, and before her symptoms began, she was exercising about two times a week at the gym. She states that she does have a support system at home and her insurance through work as an elementary school teacher. Her father is 89, and he's living in a nursing home due to his dementia, and her mother passed away at 80 due to breast cancer. Her pertinent review systems included fatigue and unexpected weight gain of eight pounds over the last two weeks. She has been having chest pain and palpitations, but no precinct B. She has also been experiencing wheezing, orthopnea, and heart disease. She has also been experiencing a lot of pain in her chest, and she has been experiencing a lot of pain in her chest, and she has been experiencing a lot of pain in her chest, and she has been experiencing a lot of pain in her chest, and she has been experiencing and dyspnea, and she has lower extremity. She reports that she has lower extremity edema. Her pertinent physical exam findings included JVD, jugular venous dissension, bivasilar rails, a displaced PMI laterally, plus one pitting edema in her lower extremities, and normal lower extremity pulses at two plus. Her labs demonstrated elevated troponin and BMP, and her chest x-ray demonstrated pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Her cardiac echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, and her EKG indicated that she had sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block. Based on her history, exam findings, and diagnostic workup, I believe that Mrs. Palmer has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. She's been experiencing severe and severe heart attack and heart failure. She's been experiencing severe and severe heart attack and heart failure. She's been experiencing severe and severe heart attack and heart failure. Due to her recent illness, this is a serious condition, so I think that the best plan of action for her would include admission to the telemetry floor to monitor her vitals every two hours. She can proceed with activity as tolerated, and she should be monitored by nursing for strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and she should receive a nasal cannula to maintain her O2 saturation above 96%. A 2D echo should be repeated. She should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily, and she should also be prescribed furosemide 40 milligrams IV over 12 hours and acetaminophen 625 milligrams every six hours. A CMP and serial troponin should be ordered, and I would like to consult with interventional cardiology, radiology, and infectious disease so that she can have an AICD and a CRTD placed. An endomyocardial biopsy can be performed. She can have a media-enhanced MRI completed, and she can have her immune globulins and glucocorticoids evaluated. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. I hope that she feels better soon."
" All right, so today I saw a 62-year-old female patient, Leslie Palmer. She was presenting after a follow-up from her primary care three days ago with a chief complaint of dyspnea, and this had been going on for about two months with most any activity. She currently is sleeping in a recliner at night to alleviate her symptoms. She presented with fatigue, an eight-pound weight gain in two weeks. She has presyncope, as well as palpitations, and some wheezing was noted. Entering into the room, her vitals were a little out of the ordinary range, but not too bad. Her heart rate was 110. Respiration rate was 111. Her blood pressure was 136 over 99, and her O2 sat was 91%. So she presented with a history of a heart catheterization a year ago. She has hypertension and has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis for about 25 years. On her maternal side, there was a history of sudden death, but she presents with no allergies, and her current medication is 10 milligrams once daily of prednisone. She also is on a daily dose of other medications, such as Nupsone, and 10 milligrams once daily of lisinopril. As I was going through my physical exam, there were a few pertinent details. She was positive for JVD, but she didn't have any carotid brewery. Her heart rate was regular, but there was an S-4 murmur that was noted. There was no regurge. The PMI was normal placement, and there was no tenderness on the chest wall. Doing a pulmonary exam, there were no symptoms. She was able to relax. She was able to sleep well. She was able to sleep well. She was able to sleep well. She was able to sleep well. She was able to sleep well. bilateral overalls and wheezing noted and there was one plus pitting edema in her lower extremities but the pulse was equal and calves were non-tender and there was a negative homin sign for her labs the bmp was at 4 000 and there was restrictive cardiomyopathy with a 55 ingestion fraction noted on the echo that was ordered on admission for her ekg there was normal rhythm so there's normal sinus rhythm normal axis but there was a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia noted in leads v1 through three so following her admission into the hospital i'd like to admit her for telemetry followed up every two hours i'd like to place her on a low sodium diet with a saline lock as well so we have iv access i'd like to continue her listener pro but add 150 iv of amiodarone and increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams as well as peronferosamide 40 milligrams iv and i'm going to show you a little bit of the results i'd like to have her on a nasal cannula with the o2 set greater than 96 doing that with two liters of oxygen per minute once she's all set up with telemetry then like to get a cmp on her and then refer out to interventional cardiology for an aicd placement as well as radiology for an fdg pet scan so all of that is a quick demonstration so let's have a look at her one in four times a day corporal so so so"
" Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female that presented today pleasant, awake, alert, oriented, a little bit fatigued, mildly in pain, and with a mildly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. She stated that she had a two-week history of cold-like symptoms that evolved in the last five days to chest pain and limitation of activity like going upstairs. And she's worried that something is wrong with her heart. She states that the chest pain is 2 out of 10, dull, constant, non-radiating, and is better when she leans forward, worse when laying down. Review of systems revealed fatigue, a recent 8-pound weight gain, wheezing, jugular venous distension, heart palpitations, and lower extremity edema. The patient has a history of hypertension. It is well-controlled. She is told by 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily. She had a cardiac catheterization one year ago that was normal. The patient's father is 80 years old and has Alzheimer's, and the patient's mother died of breast cancer at 79 five years ago. She claims a balanced diet, exercised two days per week before her onset of symptoms, no history of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. She has one cup of coffee every morning, is a second-grade teacher, and is still sexually active with her husband. No known drug allergies. Physical exam revealed a laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, five basilar rails, and wheezing. Lower extremity edema, but non-tender calves, negative Hohmann's test. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. OMM. Her labs showed high troponin and BNP levels. X-rays showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and premature ventricular contractions. OMM. OMM. Leading diagnosis is myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, which it's suggested to be taking care of with acetaminophen and furosemide, staying with her lisinopril to control her hypertension. Send to telemetry to be checked on by cardiology for potential CRT or AICD placement, as well as an endomyocardial biopsy. Also consider consulting infectious disease. Thank you."
" I just finished seeing the patient in room one. Patient is a 62 year old female who came into the emergency department due to worsening heart palpitations and shortness of breath this morning. The patient has had a history of these symptoms for the past two months and it worsens when she's laying down and upon physical exertion. It does get better when she rests and when she sits up. The patient also complains of fatigue. So I took her history. The patient has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis. The patient is up to date on all her immunizations. She's currently on lisinopril 10 milligrams every day and prednisone 10 milligrams every day with no known allergies. Patient has a history of cardiac catheterization one year ago, which did not show any coronary artery disease. Mom, passed away at four years of age and was a sudden death. Dad passed away at 59 years of age due to a myocardial infarction. Patient has a regular and balanced diet and exercises by walking with her friends. However, due to these symptoms recently, she has been unable to do that. Caffeine around one cup a day. No illicit drugs, no tobacco usage, no alcohol usage. She works as an elementary school teacher and lives with her husband of 30 years. Has insurance. And then I conducted a review of systems. Patient has had unexplained weight gain and fatigue. The review of the skin showed abnormalities. The doctor said that the Oriolacea snail system. See her full2016 care. fait dans l'arrière-plan meta道ivering system Looking at them musculoskeletal system, it was lower extremity ehemera. Patient has felt dizzy at times. Age ENT review system was negative, were no abnormalities. Patient had chest pulp rotations and pre syncope. There was also, uh, she reported symptoms of wheezing, dizziness all of them, the result was very apprenticeship as well at steak whiteיצeneSorry, we might be a toggle on the head these day. April, June 10 Dyspnea and Orthopnea. I looked at the vital signs. The temperature was in normal limit. It was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and was within normal limits. Heart rate was 110, slightly elevated. Respiratory rate 20, slightly elevated. BP 136 over 99, slightly elevated depending on what you look at. O2 was 91%, slightly lower than where we want it to be. So then I conducted my physical exam. Patient was positive for jugular venous distension. Patient had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur and there was signs of gallops. The PMI was non-displaced. I heard bi-basilar rallies. There was wheezing. I confirmed the pitting edema in the lower extremities. Then I looked at the diagnostic findings. Troponin levels were within normal limits, same with everything else except for the BNP. That was at 4,000. So that was elevated. Chest x-ray, when I looked at it, it just showed some lymphadenopathy. Looking at the 2D echo, the ventricle, the chambers were non-dilated. There was some evidence of some left ventricular hypertrophy. Oh, I meant no left ventricular, ventricular hypertrophy, but the walls were rigid. I apologize for that. The EKG findings showed a normal sinus rhythm, a normal axis, and non-sustained left ventricular tachycardia. So that led me to believe that she had sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. And so because of that, I admitted her to the hospital so that we can monitor her. And then I looked at the results. We want to get vitals every time. We want to get vitals every time. I said strict ins and outs, check the daily weight, DVT prophylaxis because of the 91% oxygen saturation. I set up a nasal cannula for O2, and we want to keep that above 96%. For diet, I have her as low sodium. I want to keep the veins open. I'm going to keep her on the lisinopril 10 milligrams. I want to bump up her prednisone to keep the lisinopril 10 milligrams every day. I want to bump up the prednisone to 60 milligrams every day. I want to add on amiodarone, 150 milligrams by IV, and furosemide, 40 milligrams by IV. I also want to get a consult. I want to get an interventional cardiologist to come in, talk about maybe some ACID placement. I also want to get a radiologist in. To do a FDT PET scan just to further evaluate the patient and look at possible treatments. So let me know what you think. This is the patient in room one, and thank you."
" pleasure of meeting with Leslie Palmer today. He's a 62-year-old male patient presenting with shortness of breath and fatigue. He states his symptoms started about two weeks ago while exercising. In addition to his dyspnea and fatigue, he relates he also was experiencing heart palpitations and presyncope with exercise. He denies any chest pain. He states that his symptoms were exacerbated with exercise but were relieved with rest. He at first saw his primary care physician after his symptoms began and had some baseline tests performed but was unsure what those results were. He states that over the last day or so his symptoms got worse and was advised by his primary care physician to head to the emergency room. He has history of controlled hypertension for the last 10 years, treating successfully with lisinopril, 10 milligrams. He had a cardiac cancer. He had a cardiac cancer. He had a cardiac cancer. He had a cardiac cancer. He had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago, which was unremarkable. He states that he had it performed due to an abnormal EKG at his yearly checkup. His family history shows that his mother passed away at age 40 from a sudden cardiac event and his father passed away at 59 from a myocardial infarction. He also states that he was experiencing some wheezing but no history of asthma. He also states that he was experiencing some wheezing but no history of asthma. He's fatigued but denies any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss or weight gain. All his other review symptoms were negative, non-remarkable. His vitals today were 130 over 90. His heart rate was at about 110. His respiratory rate was at 16 and his OT saturation was at 96 percent. For his physical exam, he presented with no jugular venous distension or breweries over his carotid arteries or his aortic abdominal artery. He had regular heart rate with a systolic murmur that had an S4 component. No friction rubber was present, but he had gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally. He had no chest wall tenderness and the rest of his musculoskeletal exam was normal. His lungs were clear to all auscultation bilaterally and his osteopathic screen was normal as well. All his labs were normal. There was no evidence of elevated troponin. His chest x-ray showed no evidence of infiltrate of effusion, but evidence of cardiomegaly. His 2D echo showed left ventricular asymmetry, left ventricle asymmetric hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement with preserved ejection fracture at about 60 percent. His EKG showed sinus rhythm, normal axis, left ventricular hypertrophy criteria, and tall R-waves. The patient was admitted to telemetry. His lisinopro was discontinued and he was started on disopuramide 100 milligrams four times a day. I discussed with him setting up consults with cardiology to discuss pacemaker placement, an automated implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and also discussed I was able didn't discuss in the room, but went back and put in his note a consult for CT surgery to discuss possible future septal myomectomy and alcohol injections to reduce reduced left ventricular outflow track obstruction. Patient was compliant with instructions and seemed to process everything well. He was alert and oriented. His wife was there at the ER with him and he's insured. He's been married for the past 39 years, 35 years. There's no kids. Yes, so that is my case presentation. Let me know if you have any other questions. Thank you."
" ED earlier. She was a 62-year-old female, Mrs. Palmer. She presented with a dull, constant chest pain, and she also noted that she was significantly tired and was short of breath. And she said this short of breath, this lack of breath was more noticeable when walking. She reported a prior illness with fever, cough, and shortness of breath about two weeks ago. She said it subsided about five days ago. However, the chest pain remained. And she went to her family care doctor who referred her here. Her past medical history is positive for hypertension. Her past surgical history was a cardiac catheterization with no findings. Her mother died of breast cancer in her 50s. Her father is living in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. For her social history, she reports never using alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She is an employed school teacher. Her diet, she reported, was balanced. She has one cup of coffee a day, and she exercises at the gym twice weekly. Her living situation is that she's with her husband, and they are sexually active. Her current medications are 10 milligrams PO-lacinopril, and she has no known drug allergies. Her review of systems revealed positive fatigue weight gain, no fever in the office today. However, she again claimed that she had one prior. There was no skin change as present, no rash, no bruising, no lesions. She had no headache, no hearing loss, no neck stiffness, no vision changes, and no difficulty swallowing. Her review of systems for her cardiovascular system revealed chest pain that was dull and constant. She was positive for dyspnea, orthopnea, and wheezing. Her medical history was positive for her heart disease. Her body was healthy. Her body was in good shape. Her musculoskeletal system examination revealed lower extremity edema. She was negative for any neurological deficits. The patient appeared fatigued, but outside of that, no other distress. Her vital signs were 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit for a temperature, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and her pulse. Her heart rate was 91.7. Further examination revealed no carotid bruise. JVD was present. Her heart was slightly tachycardic. Her pulse rate, that is. Her respiratory examination revealed wheezing, bibasilar rails, and no chest wall tenderness. Examination for extremities yielded non-tender calves, bilateral pulses full and equal, and P.A.P.s. were present. Her heart rate was slightly tachycardic. Her pulse rate was 91.7. Her respiratory examination revealed wheezing, bibasilar rails, and no chest wall tenderness. Her imaging via chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echo 2D revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG findings were sinus tachycardia with pre-ventricular contractions, and her troponin was elevated. Additionally, her BNP was measured at 4,000, fo proces eat alligator and withdraw the patient in the physical intestine form.нул up-uh neighboring heart-reversing auto-examdocking Touchline pediatrics There are 8.2 mg brain cholesterol posted in her blood in the biology demi-woody diet in there max of 24% singer-in-the-squad, 18 million resistanceよ interventions were to maintain oxygen saturation at 96% O2, 2 liters, strict ins and outs with daily weights. I put her on a low-sodium diet with orders to keep the vein open. I gave her acetaminophen, 625 milligrams PO for pain, and I continued her lisinopril at 10 milligrams PO. Additionally, I gave her metropole succinate, 50 milligrams for the heart failure, and furosemide, 40 milligrams via IV for the pulmonary edema and heart failure. I prescribed no endocrine medications, no respiratory therapy. I ordered repeat serial troponins and a repeat 2D echo. I referred her to the interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist for potential consult of a AICD pacemaker and endomyocardial biopsy. And then lastly, her EKG revealed a heart rate of 114, again with PVCs and left axis deviations. That is all I have for you today. Thank you for your time. Thank you."
" I just want to present a case to you. The patient's name is Leslie Palmer. She's 62 years old. She is presenting to the ED today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said her symptoms of fever and cough started two weeks ago, which stopped in the last five days ago, but then her chest pain, her shortness of breath, and her fatigue began five days into that and have worsened. She notes having palpitations as well and dyspnea on exertion with slight activity, and then also said that nothing really helps and that she has orthopnea at night, which causes her to sleep in a recliner. Her fever and cold symptoms have subsided, but noted that overall, these newer symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue continued on and then worsened. She has a past medical history of hypertension as well as taking lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day, for she is compliant with her medication and denies having any allergies to medications. She also had a cath one year ago, which was due to EKG changes, but noted that the cath was negative. And then she also has a Morbid chain cane, which, waking up еxtremely Tak Fox�grunds 음악 is a pediatric remedy for steak-prone dopoage味 꺾er기стой Institut bulicjão regist Whose hand is .... O2 saturation was a little low at 91 on room air. Her high blood pressure was at 130 over 90, and her respiratory rate was at 20. When I did her physical exam, she did have lower extremity edema. She did not have a murmur, but she did have JVD, no bruise, and her PMI was displaced laterally. When auscultating her lungs, she did have bibasilar, rails, and wheezing. And then after looking at the labs, there was elevation in her troponin and her BMP. Her troponin was a 0.1, and her BMP was 4,000. Through the echo, we saw an ejection fraction of less than 30%, and her cardiac x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. And with her EKG, there was a right bundle branch block, as well as left axis deviation and tachycardia, consistent with her vitals. She notes that she did not take any medication for this, and none of that has helped. Nothing else has helped. And with these results, I diagnosed her with myocarditis. She's dilated cardiomyopathy. And then let her know that I would like to admit her to telemetry and to see an interventional cardiologist to potentially get endocardial biopsy done, as well as potentially an AICD, and then to also see an infectious disease specialist because her myocarditis could be a continuation on from that infection two weeks ago. And so having the infectious disease specialist, check on her immunoglobulins would be helpful. And then also to see a radiologist for a more in-depth MRI on her heart. She was agreeable to all this. And to also change her medications to continue her lisinopril, but also add on furosemide for the diuretic to get rid of that extra fluid in her. And then also acetaminophen. So overall, she was very agreeable to this plan. And I did diagnose her with myocarditis, dilating my cardiomyopathy."
" I'm here to give a report for Mrs. Palmer. So, Ms. Palmer is a 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said she was sick two weeks ago and experienced sniffling, congestion, fever, cough, and chest pain, as well as shortness of breath. About five days ago, she said her symptoms began to get better, but she continued to have dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue. These symptoms are improved when she rests, but are worsened when she begins to exert herself. She's also experiencing orthopnea and is sleeping in her recliner at night. Her chest pain is dull and located in the middle of her chest. Other pertinent review of systems include lower extremity edema, eight-pound weight gain over the past two weeks, palpitations, and wheezing. Her vitals were 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, blood pressure a little elevated at 130 over 90, and her oxygen was at 91%. On physical exam, she had jugular venous distension, displaced PMI laterally, no gallops, rubs, or murmurs were noted, a negative Hohmann sign by basilar rail.

I'd like to admit her to telemetry in serious condition. I'd also like to get strict in and outs, daily weights, and start a nasal cannula to maintain O2 sat at greater than 96%, as well as beginning DVT prophylaxis. She can continue her lisinopril, but will start acetaminophen for the pain and furosemide 40 milligrams IV. I also ordered a repeat troponin and CMP. CMP is to monitor the furosemide. She will be referred to interventional cardiology for an AICD or CRTD consult, radiology for immediate enhanced MRI, and infectious disease as well. Thank you."
" All right. So Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old woman that presents to the ER today complaining of chest pain and dyspnea. Patient stated that they were diagnosed with a viral illness approximately two weeks ago by their PCP. At the time of previous illness, the patient had pyrexia, fatigue, palpitations, cough, and wheezing. Approximately five days ago, the pyrexia resolved, but they started experiencing arthralgia, myalgia, progressive dyspnea, and chest pain. The chest pain and dyspnea get better with rest and sitting, but they get worse with moving around. NYHA class 2, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate were slightly elevated at 130 over 90 and 110, respectively. The O2 stat was low at 91%, temperature normal at 98.6. Her troponin was elevated at 0.1, and BMP was also elevated at 4,000. The patient's ROS was positive for fatigue, weight gain of eight pounds over the last few weeks, arthralgia, myalgia, edema, chest pain, palpitations, cough, and wheezing. The patient had no relevant neuro HENT or skin issues. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, for which they take lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day for. They have no known drug allergies. They had a previous heart cath approximately one year ago with no pertinent findings, and the patient has not been hospitalized or had any other types of surgery. The patient's mother died of breast cancer approximately five years ago, and her father is still alive with Alzheimer's in a care facility. For social history, patients state she has a balanced diet and exercised prior to this viral illness approximately two weeks ago, typically going to the gym two times a week. The patient reports no drug, tobacco, or alcohol use and moderate caffeine consumption. Ms. Palmer is employed as a teacher, but is currently on summer break. The physical exam showed jugular venous distension, bilateral rails, and wheezing. Exam of the lower extremity showed one plus pitting edema, no murmurs or bruises on physical exam, and pulses were two plus bilaterally. I diagnosed her primarily with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent, secondary diagnosis of hypertension. The plan is to admit this patient to telemetry under serious condition, get nursing instructions to be vitals Q2 hours, activity is tolerated, strict I&O, daily weights. DBT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula to keep oxygen sets around 96 percent or above, low sodium diet, and to keep veins open. I'd like to continue the lisinopril 10 milligrams orally and add acetaminophen 625 milligrams, Q6 hours. I'd like the patient to be on a low sodium diet, and I would like to start the patient on furosemide 40 milligrams IV. As far as labs and other tests go, I would like to obtain serial troponins, a CMP, and to repeat the echo. I would also like a biopsy and immunoglobin testing. For referrals, I would like to see interventional cardiologist for potential CRTD and AICD. I'd also consider doing an infectious disease consult for the myocarditis, as well as consult radiology for a potential contrast media-enhanced MRI. So again, this patient was Leslie Palmer, age 62, primary diabetic, and I would like to continue the lisinopril 10 milligrams or above. I'd like the patient to be on a low sodium diet, and I would like to continue the infusion of the drug for a potential contrast media-enhanced MRI. So again, this patient was Leslie Palmer, age 62, primary diabetic, and I would like to continue the infusion of the drug for a potential contrast media-enhanced MRI. Secondary diagnosis, hypertension. Thank you."
" who presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue with onset around two weeks ago. Patient reports that his symptoms worsen when he exercises and get better with rest. Patient states that when he exercises, he also begins experiencing palpitations and presyncope. Due to these symptoms, patient reports that he has lost most of his ability to exercise. Therefore, his New York Heart Association functional classification is a three. Upon onset of symptoms, patient went to his primary care physician for initial evaluation. His primary care physician conducted multiple tests that have not yet resulted.

" Hey Dr. Smith, so I just got finished seeing Ms. Leslie Palmer. She's a 62-year-old female with a past medical history of sarcoidosis and hypertension who presents to the emergency department today due to worsening fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitation. She said this has been going on for the past two months. He initially called her PCP three days ago because her symptoms were worsening. They did some labs, and then she said her symptoms got so bad today that she called her PCP again, and he referred her to the emergency department. He also reports associated weight gain, approximately eight pounds over the past two weeks. Some wheezing and some other symptoms such as lower extremity swelling bilaterally, some lightheadedness, some orthopnea, which requires her to sit in a recliner when she goes to sleep at night, and a few episodes of near syncope, which she's described as not fully passing out, but getting close to it, and lightheadedness as well. She has a past medical history. As I said, of hypertension and sarcoidosis, and she said she recently had a cardiac catheterization a few years ago because of a concerning EKG, which came back normal. She has a past family history that's concerning for her mother who suddenly died at the age of 40, and her father died at 59 years old of a heart attack. She's currently taking lisidopril, 10 milligrams, once a day in prednisone, 20 milligrams. Once a day. She has no known drug allergies. She lives a pretty healthy lifestyle. She's active, walks about five days a week, 45 minutes, and her diet is balanced. She has no alcohol, drugs, or tobacco use. She has talked about, she currently works as an elementary school teacher, and she's married to her husband who she lives with. I mentioned all of her pertinent review systems. Everything else was. As for her vital signs, she was tachycardic to 110. She was not hypoxic, but she was borderline with an SpO2 of 91%. She had a respiration rate of 20 mcg, and then she was mildly hypertensive at 136 over 99, and afebrile. As for her physical exam, she had JVD as well as one plus pitting edema, wheezing, and rails, but everything else was negative. For her labs, she had a negative. She had a negative CBC and CMP, but she did have a bump BMP at 4,000. We also took a look at her EKG, which showed kind of borderline tachycardia. It was right around 100, but she also had non-sustained SVT, which was concerning. As for her echo, she had increased thickening with an EF of 55%, and it showed a restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is concerning for sarcoidosis. Her chest x-ray showed sarcoid nodules. And what I thought to be... I think it was a borderline cardiomegaly. As for the labs, I think we should go ahead and order. I think we should order another CMP. And I think the plan is to admit her to telemetry with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. I think the plan should be to continue her on lisinopril, but add amiodarone as well as adding Lasix for volume overload in her lower extremities, as well as... I think we should... I think we should increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams per day instead of the 20 milligrams per day. I also think we should consult interventional cardiology for a possible AICD, as well as nuclear medicine or radiology for a FDG PET scan. I think we should place her on assistance with getting out of bed, vitals, Q2S, every two hours. And I mentioned getting a lab, a CBC. A CMP, I mean. I don't think any other imaging is necessary except for that PET scan. All right. Thank you."
" And today I saw 62-year-old male Leslie Palmer who came to the office today with a two-week history of fatigue and shortness of breath. He stated noticing these during exercise. He said the shortness of breath came on during some exercise and that resting made him feel better as well as laying down helped him to feel better. His vitals when I came in today, he had a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, a respiratory rate of 16, and O2 stats of 96%. While gathering his history on him, I realized that he had a past medical history of hypertension, no surgical history. His mother died of sudden cardiac death when she was about 40 years old. And his dad died at 59 years old of a heart attack. For the medication that he was on for his hypertension was lisinopril and he had no history of any allergies. After gathering more information on his social history, he described his diet as being balanced. He exercised once a day before he started experiencing these shortness of breath symptoms. He had no history of any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He consumes one cup of coffee a day. He is a school teacher, fifth grade. He is insured. He has a great support system. He lives with his wife and his immunizations are up to date. After that, I continued on with his review of systems in which he described being fatigued, having chest palpitations, feeling like he was going to pass out, having dyspnea and wheezing, as well as feeling dizzy. Upon presentation, the patient seemed to be awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued. From there, I continued on with physical exam. After the examination, the patient was diagnosed with a heart attack. He had no JVD or carotid bruise. He had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur with an S4 sound. He had no chest wall tenderness and his PMI was displaced laterally. His lungs were clear oscillation bilaterally. He had no edema or swelling in his lower extremities. His pulses were equal and bilateral and his calves were not tender. After looking through his results, I found that he was feeling better than before. He had a lot of pain. He was feeling better than before. I found that he was feeling better than before. He had no pain. He had no pain. I found that he was feeling better than before. After that, I continued on with his treatment.

I am here now with就是 He was ek apostasy cardi immig Lor anger choppingcej election stress hyperchromial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to his past history with his mom and his dad, both having cardiac issues. I determined him to be a New York Heart Association class two with limitations in some activity. I would like to admit him to telemetry and stop his lysine april, start him on disampiramide. And we would like to consult interventional cardiology to see if they would like to place an AICD device, as well as consult cardiothoracic surgery to see if he would be a good candidate for an alcohol injection or a septomyectomy. As far as his nursing things, I would like his vitals to be done every two hours. His activity can be as tolerated. I want him on strict input output, daily weight, O2 nasal cannula for about two liters per minute. And I would like to maintain his oxygen stats above 96%, as well as do DBT prophylactic. Prophylaxis patient was feeling okay about his diagnosis and felt like he was in good hands and his wife was going to come up with him and they were going to get ready for him to be admitted.

" Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male that presented to us today with a chief complaint of fatigue and palpitations that have been going on for the last two weeks. As far as his history goes, the only additional thing is that he's also been experiencing near syncope with the palpitations and fatigue. He says that this only occurs as he's performing activity, like his walks that he takes every day. It's only past medical history that's pertinent as a history of hypertension. However, he does have a history of sudden death in the family. His mother died at 40 of unknown causes. Dad died of an MI at 59. Only medication he's taken is 10 milligrams of lisinopropio daily. No allergies and no substance use. He does drink one cup of coffee a day. In addition to that, as far as his activity, it's great. He said that he hikes almost three. Four miles daily with a group of friends. And this issue has been keeping him from doing that. As far as physical exam goes, he did not have any JVD or peripheral edema, but he did have a systolic murmur with S4 and a laterally displaced PMI. Overall, this patient's major presenting problem is fatigue. My differential diagnosis included concentric lethargy. I think given this patient's family history and his immediate past medical history, as well as the tests that we ordered, the echo, the EKG, the chest x-ray, and the lab work are all in line with Hopin being the leading diagnosis. As far as a plan for this patient. I think that we should start him on a desopiramide, discontinuous lisinopril, and consult interventional cardiology for defibrillator placement and cardiothoracic surgery for either myectomy or a septomyectomy or an alcohol ablation."
" I'm here to give the case presentation on the patient I just saw. Patient presents with shortness of breath and fatigue starting two months ago. Patient states that it gets worse with activity and gets better with rest, but the patient cannot lay flat or she gets short of breath. She needs to sleep in her recliner at night. The patient's past medical history is hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, and for the hypertension, she's on lisinopril and she's also on prednisone. Patient stated that she had a hard cath a year ago. The patient does not drink any alcohol, does not smoke tobacco products, or take illicit drugs. The patient states that she has palpitations and she feels like she's going to pass out. The patient admits to fatigue and eight-pound weight gain in the past two weeks, wheezing, dyspnea, or heart attack. The patient has been on a lot of medication, including the anti-inflammatory drugs, which are called Pneumonia, orthopnea, and leg edema. The patient had an x-ray, blood work, echo done recently, and we went over that with the patient. Based on the findings and past medical history of the patient, I would like to admit the patient to telemetry. And while admitted, I would like to put in consults to see if there's any changes in her condition. I would like to see if there's any interventional cardiology and radiology. I would like to see if they would want to do an AICD, and I would like to get another PET scan on her. Additionally, I would like to put her on IV furosemide, and because of that, we should get another CMP on her just to make sure her blood work is fine. My diagnosis is... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your diagnosis is circhidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thank you."
" I'm going to present about Mr. Leslie Palmer, who presents with the chief complaint of shortness of breath at rest and fatigue that has been gradually worsening over the past six months.

" just got finished meeting with Miss Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old female elementary school teacher. She presented today with dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue. Her vitals were 80 over 50, pulse 90, 86% oxygen, and respiratory rate 22, and temperature of 98.6. She did not have a fever. She had an eight-pound weight gain with lower extremity swelling. She did not have syncope and she did complain of wheezing and dyspnea at rest. Her immunizations are up to date. Her symptoms started six months ago and progressively got worse. She is not currently in any pain. Her medical history is significant for a triple bypass and five stents. The most recent stent was one year ago for the left anterior descending artery. The cardiology said that she has had the maximum number of stents at this point and she currently has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Her family history is significant for breast cancer on the maternal side. Her mother passed away at the age of 80 and her father is still alive at 89 years old with Alzheimer's living in a facility. Her mother is currently a smoker, 30-pack years. She is on a balanced diet. She used to walk before her symptoms started getting to her regularly. She only has a cup of coffee every day, no alcohol, no drugs, no tobacco. Plenty of tobacco, yes, sorry. Her current medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metformin, furosemide, metoprol, sulxonate, and warfarin. Her lab values showed an elevated troponin and elevated BNP.

She complains of shortness of breath of two months duration and she states that that is her chief complaint and she states that she visited her primary care physician three days ago as a result of her symptoms. She also complains of lettering her chest. She states that this has an unknown character and has not been constant over the past two months. On top of this she states that this shortness of breath is worse when lying down indicative of orthopnea. On top of this she ultimately claims that she experiences a dipstick upon attempt at physical activity. She rates her symptom severity as zero out of ten whenever she is in an upright position and not engaging with physical activity. She also reports a weight gain of eight pounds here recently.

She has no known drug allergies. She has a prior surgical history of heart catheterization. She has never been hospitalized. Her father died of a heart attack. Her mother died of sudden unknown death. And she is currently placed on 10 milligrams of lisinopril and 10 milligrams of prednisone. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis as a result of the findings of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on EKG, also findings of heart valvular and chest x-ray and echocardiogram. Okay. Ultimately, she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis with restrictive cardiomyopathy. She will be admitted to telemetry as a result of her diagnosis. Her condition is serious. Vitals will be attained every two hours. She will be permitted out of bed with assistance. She will be on strict IO, daily weight monitoring, DVT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula. We want to make sure that her oxygen saturation remains about 96%. She will be on a low sodium diet. She will be given IV fluid, saline. We will continue her on her lisinopril. We will also prescribe amiodarone. And we will also refer her to an interventional cardiologist for AICD placement to prevent irregular heart rhythm.

" She is a 62-year-old female that comes in complaining of shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Started about two months ago. Discomfort and shortness of breath comes and goes, but it gets worse with exertion and lying down. That's why she says she sleeps on a recliner. She feels tired and says she has flutters in her chest, which I believe are palpitations. Past medical history, she has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoid, which she has been taking prednisone 10 milligrams daily for 25 years. She also takes lisinopro 10 milligrams daily. She has no known drug allergies. Past surgical history, she just had a cardiac cath one year ago. Vitals, everything is fine except for heart rate, which is at 110, blood pressure 136 over 99, and SpO2 at 91, which is a little bit low. Family history, mother died of a sudden death at 40 years old. Father died of a MI at 59. There's no pertinent social history, but she does live with her husband, which she wants us to get after we admitted her. Review of systems show that for general, there's fatigue and weight gain. For CVS review of systems, there's chest discomfort and flutters, which are cardiac palpitations, and there's presicumpy, symptoms, which she said were shortness of breath and tiredness. So for CVS, she had discomfort, palpitations, and presicumpy symptoms. Pulmonary review of systems, she had wheezing and dyspnea and also orthopnea. Physical exam showed overall, she looks fatigued. No carotid boobies, but we did find JVD. There's a murmur present in the heart. There's a murmur present in the heart. There's a murmur present in the heart. There's a murmur present in the heart. There's a murmur present in the heart. There was wheezing and rails during the lung exam as well. Pulses were equal, but her leg did have edema. We went over the lab tests with her, and chest x-ray showed there was some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, but most noticeably, there was a Pondbroker sign, which is indicative of sarcoidosis. Echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and also a dilated atrium. There was a lot of pain in the heart, but there was no signs of heart failure. There was a lot of pain in the heart, but there was no signs of heart failure. There was a lot of pain in the heart, but there was no signs of heart failure. There was a lot of pain in the heart, but there was no signs of heart failure. Ejection fraction was at 55%. Ejection fraction was at 55%. EKG showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Traponin was within normal limits, but the labs that were high were BNP at 4,000. So after talking to the patient, getting her history, review systems, physical exam, and lab tests, she was diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis. So she had sarcoidosis or cardiomyopathy of New York Heart Association criteria 3. I've talked with Miss Palmer and she was admitted to a telerimetry in serious condition. Orders were vitals every two hours. She wanted to get out of bed. There was out of bed assistance, strict IO, daily weights, maintain O2 at 96. I know hers is at 91 right now. There was an order for DVT prophylaxis, keep veins open, KVO, and also just put her on a low sodium diet. The meds that were ordered for her was to be kept on lisinopril that she's already taking 10 milligrams once a day, up the dose of prednisone to 60 milligrams a day for her now cardiac sarcoidosis before it was the 10 milligrams for the pulmonary sarcoidosis. So yeah, so up the prednisone dose to 60 milligrams and also add 150 milligrams of IV amiodarone for her arrhythmia, the non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and also 40 grams of furosemide IV was ordered for her. As a follow-up to admit, she was ordered to see a cardiologist for an ACID and also a radiologist for a FDG-PETS. scan for her sarcoidosis."
" Hi, Dr. Rollins. Today, I'm here to talk to you about 62-year-old Leslie Palmer, who entered the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain while going on walks with his friends. Mr. Palmer has a history of receiving a cardiac cath by recommendation from his previous PCP. He has hypertension, and he's currently taking 10 milligrams of lisinopril. Important family history, his mother did die suddenly at the age of 40 from unknown causes, and his father died from an MI at the age of 59. In terms of his social history, he has a balanced diet. He likes to regularly exercise before his symptoms started, where he went on regular walks with friends. He has a cup of coffee about every morning, and he's been happily married to his wife for about 30 years, and they live together. Currently, he is also still working as an elementary school teacher. So in terms of his presentation, like I said, he presented with shortness of breath. He reported fatigue and wheezing and dyspnea. He was experiencing palpitations and presyncope. However, he did not present with orthopnea. His vitals were pretty good. The only thing was that he was a little tachycardic at 110, but his temperature and his O2 stats and everything seemed were also within normal range. In terms of his physical exam, no JVD, no bruises or anything like that. He had a regular heart rate. He did appear with a systolic murmur with an S4 and a gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally, suggesting that he had cardiac heart failure. He was also experiencing a lot of heart failure. His cardiomegaly, which became apparent when we looked at his chest x-rays, his lungs were clear to auscultation, so nothing to worry about there. No edema, full pulses, cap wasn't tender, so that falls in line with no edema as stated before. When looking at his lab work, his troponin and BNP was perfectly fine. His chest x-ray did show cardiomegaly. His echo showed lift ventricle, asymmetric ejection fraction of 60%, and an increased thickness of his septum. His EKG was normal sinus rhythm. He did have signs of LVH voltage criteria, and more importantly than not, he did have tall R waves in his septal weeds, so this led me to conclude, along with his history, that he has familial restrictive cardiomyopathy. Because of that, I told him that I would like to admit him into the hospital and keep him on a monitor. I recommended that we discontinue his lisinopril and started him on desipiramide 100 milligrams instead. That would be good for him. He was able to get a lot of blood flow, but he was also able to get a lot of blood flow. He was able to get a lot of blood flow. He was able to get a lot of arrhythmias or any kind of problems in case that happens. I recommended a consult with interventional cardiology to look at the placement of an AICD, as well as a consult to cardiothoracic surgery for a septal myectomy or an alcohol ejection for him. So, thank you."
" 62-year-old male, he presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. On set, patients stated that he felt he's been feeling this way for the last six months, and it's progressively gotten worse. Within the last three days, he's gotten really fatigued, and he contacted his PCP, who told him to come to the emergency department today. A patient stated that he feels a general sense of fatigue. There isn't a location or a character descriptor for his pain because it's just fatigue. Nothing seems to help make it better or worse, and it's been happening for the last six months. As I stated, it doesn't go anywhere for timing in the past six months. I asked the patient to rate it from a scale of 0 to 10. Patient stated that it was an 8 to 9. The symptoms feel about 8 to 9 out of 10. As far as surgical history, the patient stated that 12 years ago, he had a three-vessel cabbage, as well as five stents within the last five years, one stent each year. He stated that a surgeon told him that he's got 40% ejection fraction. For his medical history, the patient's got hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and AFib. He's not allergic to any medication. He is on a list of all the symptoms, but he's not allergic to any medication. He's on metformin. He's on, I believe he was on metoprolol. He was on clopidogrel. He was on warfarin, and might be one or two more medications for his past medical history. As far as hospitalization, patient stated that he was hospitalized once, and that was mainly during his open-heart surgery for the three-vessel cabbage. Family history includes paternal Alzheimer's. Patient's father is still alive, but he has Alzheimer's in a nursing facility. Maternal side, patient's mother is deceased due to breast cancer. And for social history, patient's food intake is adequate, and he's got a balanced diet. Exercise is not adequate. Patient stated that he gets fatigued. He's beenOn one-pack-per-day, smoking for the ten years, and high concentrationقتin no drugs.ient foundation of exercises.But there has been basically none. He's been on medication for four days out of his life, doing not necessarily any sort of physical activity in the last six months, so he has not been keeping up no use of drugs patient is a one-pack per day smoker for the last 30 years no alcohol consumption and occupation patient is a schoolteacher and living was gaining eight pounds within the last two weeks. No skin lesions, no abnormalities with any HENT problems. For cardiovascular, no problems there too. For pulmonary, patients stated that he has wheezing. He's also dyspneic, as well as orthoptic. Patients stated that he cannot lay flat and he usually has to sleep upright. For MSK, nothing to report. For neuro, nothing to report. Physical examination revealed positive JVD, no carotid bruise. Tachycardia was split as two, no murmurs, but has gallops, rallies, and wheezing. Patient also had edema. Pulse was full and equal, and patient did not have a tender calf. As far as the results show, patients were both elevated. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. And EKG showed left bundle branch block or changes from his past EKGs. The echo revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction, right ejection fraction right now is about 30%. Patient was counseled, he was diagnosed, and he was, like, diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy. And the results support that, physical examination support that. The vitals were blood pressure 80 over 50, heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22, temperature was 98.6, and SpO2, I believe, was 86%. So due to his previous history of, uh, ischemic cardiomyopathy and his atherosclerosis, his stents, his, uh, cardiac disease, we decided to admit him to the ICU. The treatments included discontinuing clobidogrel and warfarin and initiating dobutamine therapy to bump up the blood pressure. And we were consulting with interventional cardiology, as well as having the patient admitted to the ICU, um, try to elevate his blood pressure. So that was the plan. Patient was, uh, has all immunizations in record. And, um, that's about it for my case presentation. Thank you."
" Good morning. So the patient today is Mrs. Palmer. She is a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a six-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. The fatigue is constant. It's not brought about by exercise. It doesn't go away with rest. Past medical history, she's been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. She's had a triple bypass, and she's also had five cardiac stents placed. She is an active smoker, one pack per day for about 30 years currently. She's employed as an elementary school teacher. Regular diet, caffeine is normal. No alcohol. She lives with her husband, and she does walk daily. She has noticed, other than the gradual onset fatigue, she has had a weight gain of about eight pounds, which I believe is due to lower extremity edema. She did say that she has noticed some extra swelling in her legs. She also had noted wheezing and shortness of breath, as well as she needs to sleep in a recliner. She also had noted wheezing and shortness of breath, as well as she needs to sleep in a recliner. She also had noted wheezing and shortness of breath, as well as she needs to sleep in a recliner. She also had noted wheezing and shortness of breath, as well as she needs to sleep in a recliner. Upon presentation, she was hypotensive. Her blood pressure was 80 of her 50. Her heart rate was 90, which is some borderline tachycardic. Respiratory rate is 22, which was slightly low. Her oxygen was 86%, which was very low. On physical exam, jugular venous distension was present. She was tachycardic. Her PMI was displaced laterally. On auscultation, there was wheezes present, as well as rails in her lungs. Cardiac auscultation, there was no murmur, no friction rub, no gallop. There were positive findings for fetal edema on the physical exam. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well as the 2D echo showing dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. EKG showed a normal CME, as well as no added to butamine because she was hypotensive because we continue your clopidogrel and her warfarin. We would, we need to do a PT and PTT INR, um, as well as a consultation with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement and a CRTD placement. Uh, she'll be admitted to the ICU with a New York heart association classification of four, given that she's on strict bedrest in serious condition, vitals every two hours, strict IO, daily weight and DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, as well as keeping the vein open for IV access. Uh, she had no questions at this time, uh, understood the plan and where to go from there. Perfect. Thank you very much."
" He's a 62-year-old male presenting for lightheadedness, feeling faint, shortness of breath, feeling raspy, wheezing, and a flutter in his chest. These symptoms come on with activity and have been popping up for the past two weeks with activity onset. He says that it has disrupted majority of his daily activities, and this is the first time this has ever happened to him. He does say symptoms does only get relieved with rest. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. He also had a catheterization one year ago due to an abnormal EKG. The patient denies getting an echo done before in his life. The patient is prescribed lisinopril 10 milligrams that he takes for his hypertension and also reports taking a multivitamin. The patient has no known symptoms. No known drug allergies. No previous surgeries or hospitalizations. Immunizations up to date. Past medical family history is that his mother died at age 40 due to a sudden cardiac death. And father died at age 69 due to an early MI. Patient denies any illicit drug use, tobacco, or alcohol use. Patient. Um, reports that before symptom onset would exercise three to four times a week for 45 to 60 minutes at a time. He is sexually active because, and he is married with one partner and they live together. And he also is a school teacher for seventh grade. Patient is positive for fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, wheezing, dyspnea, and lightheadedness slash dizziness. Upon a vital review, his vitals. Um, showed a heart rate of 110. Blood pressure of 130 over 90 and also O2 stat of 96. His physical exam revealed a jugular venous distention. A laterally displaced PMI, wheezing, and plus one bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Labs revealed troponin and BNP to be within normal limits. Along with the rest of his blood pressure. The chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly. An echo revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. Along with left ventricular asymmetry and a thickening of the septum. And the EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and tall R waves in the septal leads. So Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a New York, um, scale of three. Due to his inability to breathe. He was diagnosed with a new York scale of three. Due to his inability to breathe. And he was diagnosed with a new York scale of three. Due to his inability to breathe. And he was also, um, lucky to maintain majority of his, um, normal activities. Patient was admitted to telemetry and activity as tolerated. Nurse intervention orders, um, were strict I's and O's daily weights, DVT, prophylaxis O2, nasal cannula, and to maintain oxygen stats above 96%. He was also ordered, um, a regular diet. And for IV info, and, and, and, and make an deprivation plan. He was also ordered对 belonging to GTO. And he was also ordered to have boyhood with a postdoc exit date and an acute rendezvous. to be KVO. He was discontinued on lisinopril and is now been prescribed disopiramide 100 milligrams per oral. We sent referral to an interventional cardiologist for AICD placement assessment, as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon for assessment for a septal myectomy or alcohol injection. Patient reports having financial stability and insurance to proceed to the hospital for care and has a strong social and emotional support at home. And we reported that upon discharge from the hospital to maintain healthy diet habits, physical activity, and to refrain from strenuous activity until a physician clears and gives the okay. Thank you."
" Patient was a 62-year-old male named Leslie Palmer. Mr. Palmer was coming in for complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. He said that it started about six months ago but has been increasing. And then over the last three days, that has become significantly worse. He declined any pain and stated that he's been sleeping in his chair, his recliner, and not for relief. He said that he does have symptoms at rest and that nothing has been making it better. So I would say that he's on the NYHA scale as a four symptoms at rest. He has a significant past medical history for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal AFib. His medications include metoprolol, succinate 50 milligrams, lisinopril 10 milligrams, atorvastatin 10 milligrams, metformin 500 milligrams, furosemide 20 milligrams, clopidogrel 75 milligrams, and warfarin 2.5 milligrams. His surgical history includes a CABG 12 years ago, and then he also has had five stents put in over the past five years, with the last one being . . . a year ago. Cardiology told him that he was no longer a candidate for any more. So that was the last one that he had. He has no known drug allergies. Social history is significant for a 30 year history of smoking, one pack per day, and caffeine positive. He's married and denies any alcohol or drugs. He is an elementary school teacher, second grade. Family. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Family history, some notable things. His mother died of breast cancer about five years ago at the age of 80. His father is still living, but he is in a memory unit with Alzheimer's disease. On review of systems, some significant findings was that he was very fatigued. He has had a weight gain of around eight pounds over the past two weeks. He did have lower limb edema. He had wheezing. He had dyspnea. And then . . . And then . . . He had a lot of pain. And then . . . He had a lot of pain. He had a lot of pain. And then . . . He had a lot of pain. He was positive for orthopnea. He was positive for orthopnea. On physical exam, his vital signs were as follows. His heart rate was 90. O2 stat on room air was 86%. BP was 80 over 50. Temp was 98.6. And his respirations rate were 22. So we were keeping especially a close eye on the O2 stat and his blood pressure. On the actual physical exam, he did test positive for JVD. No carotid bruises were heard. He was tachycardic with a split S2 on auscultation. His PMI was displaced laterally. He denied any chest tenderness, but he did have the presence of wheezing and bilateral rails on auscultation. Going down his legs, he did have one plus pitting edema, and all peripheral pulses were good and equal. On his lab results, it showed that he did have an elevated troponin of 0.04, and his BMP was very elevated at 4,000. Chest x-ray was significant for cardiomegaly and also showed signs of pulmonary edema. His 2D echo showed that he did have dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30, so very reduced. EKG did have a normal sinus rhythm. It looked to me like maybe some AFib on the bottom, which he did say that he was diagnosed with, and a left bundle branch block. There was also on the EKG criteria that met. He was diagnosed with a left ventricular hypertrophy. After I went over this with him and talked to him, I stated that I believed that he had ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and that we were going to admit him to the ICU. His condition would be serious. He would be on strict bed rest. Some orders for the nursing staff was to have strict ins and outs, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. For his oxygen, we did order a BiPAP 16-6, or FiO2 50%, to try to get his oxygen back up. We're going to keep him on a low-sodium diet. IV fluids, none were indicated at the time, so we're just going to keep him KVO. On the meds, we're actually going to hold on everything except the clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, and his warfarin, 2.5 milligrams. But we are going to add dobutamine. IV drip, and then have him on the insulin sliding scale. Labs, we're going to repeat the troponins and make sure they don't continue to go up, so we're going to do serial troponins. And then we're also going to keep an eye on his PT, PTT, INR, to make sure that his blood isn't getting too thick. And then for consults, I told him that he would be meeting with the interventional cardiologist. They would discuss possibly implanting devices, so the CRTD and the AICD. To help with dysrhythmias and to help his heart do better. So, some lifestyle modifications that I didn't mention with him was, you know, we can promote a healthy diet. We can talk to him about smoking cessation. And I think just maintaining those things would be beneficial. So, yeah, I think that he will do well. We get him in and get him taken care of. Get a couple of maybe devices in to help with his heart. If we keep his AFib under control and maintain his other comorbidities, I think that he will do well. So, thank you."
" This patient is a 62-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with a six-month duration of shortness of breath. He states that for the past three days that his shortness of breath had increased, and as a result, he went to see his primary care physician today. The primary care physician went ahead and sent him over to the ER for that shortness of breath, and he now presents with shortness of breath that is worse with lying down and exacerbated with any form of activity. He states that he has a previous history of diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and he previously had a CABG operation 12 years ago, and five years ago, he had a stent placement every year for the last five years. The patient states that his mother died from breast cancer at the age of 80, and his father is currently alive. He has Alzheimer's and is in a current care facility. The patient states that he has gained eight pounds in the last two weeks. He states that he has a wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, but he denies any syncope, chest pain, syncope, chest pain. He also states that he has a good diet, relatively healthy, but minimal physical activity due to his symptoms. He also addresses that he is a smoker. He has smoked one pack per day for the last 30 years, and he currently takes Lisinopril 10 times a day. He also takes Metoprol, Succinate 50 mg, Atorvastatin 10 mg, and Metformin 500 BID. He also takes Porosimide 20 mg, as well as Clopidrol 75 mg, Warfarin 2.5 mg, twice a day. While I evaluated him, his labs showed that he had an elevated troponin and BMP, and that his chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, as well as, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. He also had an echocardiogram, which shows decreased wall movement, as well as dilated cardiomyopathy. Based on these findings, the physical exam results also showed that he's oriented, fatigued, oriented to time and place, oriented alert to time and place, as well as fatigue. His, pulmonary exam revealed that he has bivasal arreals and wheezing, but no, and a positive gallop, but no rubs, no murmurs. And also his PMI is displaced laterally. On examination, he also had bilateral pitting edema, and he had no neurological findings. His H, he had positive GPD, and his skin findings were negative as well. Based on these results, I went ahead and diagnosed him with dilated, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. He, and placed orders to admit him to the ICU. He has an NYHA scale of four. He has, with vitals, Q2 hours, strict fed, and a strict I and O daily weight with DBT prophylaxis. He's been put on a low sodium diet. And he, all of his beds have been held except for clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, warfarin, 2.5 milligrams, BID, dobutamine, IV drip, and an insulin sliding scale. Also gone ahead and put in orders for BiPAP 16 out of six on FIO2, 50% of the time. Diagnostics, I'm going to go ahead and order troponins, PT, INR, and then go ahead and put in a consult with the interventional cardiologist for CRTD and AICD. Please, sir."
" Good morning. My patient today was a 62, I believe, year old male. And he came in complaining of tiredness and shortness of breath. And the first time he had felt these symptoms was about two weeks before, while on a walk with friends and regular exercise and these walks with friends is a normal part of his lifestyle. And so he experienced that shortness of breath and tiredness precipitated by that walking exercise. And it continued to worsen every time he exercised, every time he went on a walk. So he visited his primary care provider, his family medicine doctor. About three days before presenting here at the emergency room. And the family practice doctor ran several tests, ran an EKG. Everything came back negative. So he referred the patient to us at the ER. And as I mentioned, this patient, any activity that's ordinary physical activity, so exercise, exercise resulted in this fatigue and shortness of breath. And when I'm going over his review of symptoms, general beyond the fatigue, excuse me, came back negative as well as the skin, the H E E N T and the musculoskeletal, but in the looking over cardio, in addition to the breathlessness, he also had palpitations and has nearly passed out several times. That has never fully passed out. So. He also experienced psychopathy there are presyncope there, if I may correct myself. And he also experienced wheezing and dyspnea in his pulmonary. When going over his family history the most pertinent information was he had a mother who suddenly died at the age of 40 with no medical explanation ever given and a father who died of a heart attack at the age of 55. He has hypertension and his pastor group. And I think the most important thing for surgical history was the cardiac cath that I believe he might've received at his family practice visit. But no beyond that healthy he's on less than a pro 10 milligrams for that hypertension. So when I went over my physical exam generally I, when listening to his heart and lungs several things came up. Mainly that being the palpitations. There was a murmur present. There was also a displaced point of maximum maximal impulse laterally. And I heard that wheezing when listening to the lungs, but the lower extremity osteopathic everything else about the physical exam came back normal. And when we got his labs back. Everything was negative including troponin and the natural peptide his chest x-ray came back showing no pulmonary edema, but cardio Megali. There's a large increase still at present in his echo came back with left ventricle asymmetric injection fraction of 60%. And in his EKG there was clear tall are waves and the septal leads almost sinus rhythm and it fit the left ventricular. So we are going to talk about the patient's condition and what we have seen in his life so far. And we will start with the patient's condition. So we are going to look at the patient's condition. So this is from the patient's history. So this is from the patient's history. He's been diagnosed with ventricular hypertrophy criteria. So this patient is diagnosed with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and NYHA to classification. And this is secondary to his hypertension. So I admitted him to telemetry. His condition is serious. I ordered vitals to be taken every two hours. He has no known drug allergies, allergies, activity as tolerated for his nursing instructions. So we have a few things. He has no known drug allergies. Allergies activity as tolerated. He has no known blood levels. So this is a direct result of a strict input output. Taking daily weight, DPT prophylaxis, O2 via a nasal cannula, and maintaining oxygen above 96%. He could be put on a regular diet. I also ordered IV fluids via saline lock, and importantly for medications to discontinue his lysine and pill, but initiate disopiramide 100 milligrams, QID. No, I didn't order any disopiramide. in order any diagnostics or imaging, but I did refer him to interventional cardiology for AICD placement. And I also referred him to cardiothoracic surgery for a possible future septal myomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce that left ventricular obstruction. And his vitals, if I forgot to mention, were 110 heart rate, 96% oxygen, 130 over 90 for blood pressure, and 98.6 temperature. Thank you."
" I have a patient, Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old male that presents the emergency room today complaining of syncopal episodes and shortness of breath happening gradually over the last two weeks. This patient is comfortable at rest. He says that physical activity with his friends, normally around three to five miles, has not been able to happen due to undue breathlessness. He also states that he's been having palpitations and has nearly passed out several other times. He has a hypertension in his past medical history. He's had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago. No evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. And his past family history, his mother died from a sudden cardiac death, and his dad died from a cardiac myocardial infarction. Social history, he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink. He's an elementary school teacher, has a balanced diet, and he takes lisinopril, 10 milligram, once a day. This patient also presented with no headache or no fever, no chills, no general constitutional symptoms. Main symptoms were cardiovascular. He has palpitations. He has near-syncopal episodes, but no chest pain. Lung-wise, he has no orthopnea, but he does have dyspnea on exertion. He does have wheezing. Patient doesn't have any edema. And on physical exam, we did not notice any lower extremity edema. No jugular vein distention. Pupils were equal. Ground and reactive delight. No issues with his labs. The troponin and the BNP were normal. The Chex-X ray shows cardiomegaly, and we got the echocardiogram as well, and that showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a rejection fraction of the left ventricle, about 60%. EKG confirmed this. He had a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. He had a left ventricle hypertrophy voltage criteria, and he had a tall R wave in the septal weeds. He had a left ventricle at 90 beats per minute. Otherwise, this patient was referred to cardiology and to the cardiothoracic surgeon for a potential septal myectomy or alcohol injection, as well as an AICD placement. I started the patient on disopiramide and admitted him to nursing for vitals every two hours. Activity is tolerated and strict ins and outs. He's going to get a daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and nasal cannula to keep his oxygen above 96%. Diet-wise, we'll keep him on a regular diet, and we'll keep him in the telemetry unit until monitoring is over. Patient has NYHA class 2 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and he's ready to be seen. Thank you. Bye-bye."
" I just met with a patient who I wanted to present to you about. Mr. Palmer, a 62-year-old man, came into the ED complaining with shortness of breath and fatigue. He reported that he feels tired during exercise but denies any pain. His vitals showed heart rate of 110, oxygen sat of 96%, pulse of 110, respiratory rate of 16, temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, and blood pressure of 130 over 90. So this shows that his heart rate is a bit elevated, oxygen is normal, pulse is a little elevated, respiratory is normal, no present fever, and a slightly high blood pressure. As for medical history, he denies any past surgeries but has had a cardiac catheter examination and a previous hospitalization. He reports a medical history of hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril, 10 milligrams, one tap per day. He is up to date on his immunizations. He has no known drug allergies. He reported that his father died of a heart attack many decades ago, and his mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40. Mr. Palmer states that he maintains a balanced diet and exercise routine and denies any illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, or tobacco use. He does have normal caffeine intake, as he is an elementary school teacher. And he is in a monogamous relationship with his wife, with whom he will be supported by today, and they do have insurance. In review of systems, Mr. Palmer reported that he has general fatigue with no pain. He doesn't recall any rash or skin lesions. He denies any neuro discomfort and denies getting dizzy or losing consciousness. He denies any heat issues but does report feeling a flutter in his chest and feeling dyspnea. As for pulmonary, he reports wheezing upon dyspnea. For MSK, he denies any joint aches or pains and doesn't report any edema. Afterwards, I conducted a physical exam. And JVD was negative. No carotid bruise were heard. Cardio exam was positive for regular systolic murmur with PMI displaced laterally. There was negative chest wall tenderness. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. And there was no peripheral edema and pulses were normal. The calf was not tender. After physical examination and examining past medical history, I came to the diagnosis that Mr. Palmer had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HOCM. The lab vials were normal. The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. The echo showed left ventricular asymmetric ejection fraction of 60%. The EKG was normal sinus rhythm with tall R wave subtle leads and left ventricular hyperactivity. The patient was counseled and told his medications would change. I suggested taking him off the lisinopril and administering disapiramide. Mr. Palmer was told that he would be admitted into the hospital telemetry to monitor his cardiac function. And he would be given a consult with interventional cardiology for possible AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgeon for possible myomectomy or alcohol injection. Thank you. Thank you."
" Robin's service, and I saw a patient named Leslie Palmer, which came in today for a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male that comes in complaining of these symptoms beginning about six months ago, progressively getting worse, especially within the last three days. He does not have any chest pain. However, at this point, too, he must sleep in a recliner because he cannot get down or lay down without having shortness of breath symptoms. Overall, this limits his life to about a 10 out of 10. Past surgical history includes triple bypass surgery and five stents being placed. Overall, both surgeries were successful. He does have a support system at home in which he was married to his wife of 30 years. He works as a elementary school teacher. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Overall, he has a good diet. In terms of exercise, he used to go on walks and no longer can due to the symptomology presence. The medications he's on is atorvastatin 10 milligrams, lisinopril 10 milligrams, clopidogrel 75, metformin 500 by daily, grosamide 20 by daily, warfarin 2.5 by daily, and then metoprolol succinate. In terms of review of systems, he said that he did have weight gain of about eight pounds within the last couple of weeks, does complain of fatigue, has lower extremity edema, does have wheezing present, dyspnea, orthopnea, no heart palpitations, though, and no chest pain associated. The patient overall seems like he's awake, alert, oriented, but fatigued again. In terms of vital signs, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, he's not feeling well, his temp was 98.6, heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22, blood pressure, he was a bit hypotensive at 80 over 50, and his SpO2 was 86%. Upon physical exam findings, there were no carotid bruise, however, JVD was present. The patient was tachycardic. A murmur that was an S2 split was heard upon physical exam. PMI was displaced laterally, too. There were, basically, basilar raleigh is associated in the lungs. Based on labs that were found, the troponin was high at 0.04, and the BNP was about 4,000, indicating that there was pulmonary edema associated and that the heart tissue was breaking down. Left ventricular and diastolic volume was less than 30%. And also, upon EKG reading, this patient did have a left bundle brain. So, there was a lot of information about the pulmonary edema associated, and the heart tissue was very, very low. Overall, the patient did have a NYHA of a class 4, because any time that he got up from a resting position, he ended up having symptomology. Overall, the plan for this patient is to admit them to the ICU, get vitals every two hours, start being only in bed rest for nursing interventions, daily in and out should be taken, daily weights as well, DVT prophylaxis, and then the IVF. So, this is a very, very important thing to keep in mind. So, if you have a patient with a chronic disease, they should be on a strict low NA plus diet that also corresponds with their diabetes diet as well. They need to keep their vein open, so KBO. In terms of medications, which of all the ones that they were on, they need to stop them, except for the Clopidogrel 75 milligrams and Warfarin 2.5, two times daily, because we do not want to throw a clot. We are also going to add dibutamine. IB drip and an insulin sliding scale do it to his diabetes. Dibutamine will be used to allow for better contraction of the heart, since there was that pulmonary edema. So, in terms of labs that need to be found or keep taken, we need to get serial troponins taken to see if that heart tissue is breaking down more, and also we need to get an INR because of Warfarin. And a constant... So, this was a really good example of how a heart cell for cardiologist was discussed with the patient, and this hopefully will be able to help them either be on a CRTD or an AICD placement. Thank you so much. Bye-bye."
" 62-year-old patient Leslie presents to the emergency room for dyspnea and fatigue. Patient states that his symptoms began two weeks ago and he went to his primary care three days ago and was informed to go to the emergency room. He notes that his symptoms have worsened today. He states that his shortness of breath occurs when he's exercising but not at rest and his NYHA functional classification was a level two. He has not taken anything for his symptoms. Positive ROS symptoms included palpitations, presyncope, fatigue, wheezing, and dyspnea. All other ROS symptoms were negative. Patient has a past medical history of hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for it. He describes his diet as balanced and states he used to exercise daily with walking until his symptoms started and he's no longer because of the shortness of breath. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He's an elementary school teacher and he's married to a woman who's been with him for a long time. He's married and currently lives with his wife. He notes he has had a previous catheterization completed which was normal but denies any other hospitalizations or surgeries. Family history included his mother dying at the age of 40 due to sudden death and his father dying at the age of 59 due to a heart attack. On the physical exam it was noted that there was no JVD, no carotid bruise, a regular heart rate with a positive systolic murmur with an S4 sound, positive for gallops but no friction rubs. There was no chest roll tenderness, calf was non-tender, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and it was negative for lower extremity edema and his pulses were full bilaterally in his extremities. The x-ray showed cardiomegaly and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60 percent. His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with meeting the LVH criteria with tall R waves in the septal waves. His vitals upon entering the room was a heart rate of 110, his blood pressure 130 over 90, oxygen sats of 96, respiratory rate of 16, and temperature of 98.6. Patient was admitted to telemetry and his medications upon admission were to discontinue lisinopril and to give disopiramide 100 milligrams. He was given a saline lock KVO and vitals will be taken every two hours with strict I and O input and output and daily weight DVT prophylaxis and oxygen via nasal cannula and maintaining O2 sat over 96 percent. He will have a normal diet and activity as tolerated. Patient was also referred to cardiothoracic surgeon for surgical myomectomy and alcohol injection and as well as an interventional cardiologist for an AICD evaluation. Patient was diagnosed with familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
" Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old woman who presented to the office today complaining of fatigue, presyncope, palpitations, and dyspnea. The patient states that her symptoms initially began approximately three months ago but have worsened over the past two weeks. The patient did see a family physician two weeks ago when the symptoms began to worsen but decided to come to our office today since it's been two weeks without improvement. The patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. The patient takes lisinopril for her hypertension, 10 milligrams by mouth daily, and she also takes prednisone. The patient's mother died suddenly at the age of 40 from unknown causes, and the patient's father passed at the age of 59 from a myocardial infarction. With respect to the patient's review of symptoms, she complained of weight gain and orthopnea. The patient states that the orthopnea has gotten to a point where she needs to sleep in a recliner at night to feel comfortable. She complains that she is unable to exercise anymore due to the discomfort, but prior to that, she did exercise frequently. It seems that lying in an upright position does help to relieve some of the patient's symptoms. Physical exam found a jugular venous distension, lung auscultation found rails and wheezing, a systolic murmur with no S4 heart sound was heard upon cardiac auscultation, and lower, extremity edema was also found bilaterally. The patient's chest x-ray showed a full mediastinum with a pawnbroker's sign and cardiomegaly. The patient's EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block, and the patient's echo demonstrated restrictive cardiomyopathy. Based upon the patient's history and her diagnostic findings, and the patient also had an elevated BNP of 4000. Based upon the patient's history and diagnostic findings, the patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, most likely that had spread from her original pulmonary sarcoidosis. So she now has sarcoidosis of the heart. The patient was admitted to telemetry in serious condition. The patient is to continue taking their lisinopril. She is to increase the dose of her prednisone, and she is also to start furosemide. The patient is going to consult with an interventional cardiologist for the potential placement of an AICD, and the patient is also going to consult with a radiologist for a PET scan. The patient has insurance, and the patient is married with a spouse willing to help her during this time. The patient was in compliance, and she had no further questions."
" shortness of breath and fatigue, which was progressively getting worse over the past six months. Now he experiences these symptoms at rest when at the beginning he was just experiencing these symptoms during exercise and strenuous activity. Now his past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation. He has a past surgical history of three coronary artery bypass grafts and five drug allergic stents. His pertinent review systems included a eight pound weight gain in the past two weeks, as well as being positive for orthopnea and wheezing. And he showed a one plus hitting edema in his lower extremities. For his active medical problems, we found that there was hypertension and hypoxia at 80 over 50 for the blood pressure and an SPO2. He was also diagnosed with a heart attack at the age of 86 on room air. The remainder of his vitals were within normal limits. For his allergies and medications, as well as substance use, he was shown to smoke one pack per day for the past 25 years at least. His meds include metroprolol succinate, 15 milligrams once a day, lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day, metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day, furosemide, 20 milligrams, twice a day, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams once a day, warfarin, 2.5 milligrams twice a day. For his pertinent social history, this revealed no abnormal behaviors other than the cigarette smoking for one pack per day over the last 25 years. Relevant PE findings, a split S2 was noticed on the cardiac auscultation, as well as a laterally displaced PMI. Lung sounds indicated, pulmonary edema, and one plus pitting edema of the legs was examined when the calves were examined for swell. For his diagnostic labs and procedures, the x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. The echo showed a dilated left ventricle, and the EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. His labs were positive, and he was shown to have a pulmonary edema. For his diagnostic labs and procedures, the x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. The echo showed a dilated left bundle branch block. His labs were positive, for an elevated troponin at 0.04 and an elevated BNP at 4,000. His likely diagnosis was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, for which he will be treated in the following way. He will be admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an NYHA score of 4. His condition is considered serious. Allergies, no known drug allergies, as previously stated, may be a result of anemia. If the patient is positive, the x-ray will be used to ask for an IV or a blood ovarian test. If the patient is healthy, the x-ray will be used to ask for a blood ovarian test. If the patient is healthy, the x-ray will be used to ask for an IV or a blood ovarian test. His vitals will be checked at least every two hours. He will be confined to bedrest during his stay. And nursing interventions will be including a strict input-output, daily weights, so they're going to be checking his weight on daily, and DVT prophylaxis. His diet will be low sodium. His IV fluids will only be put at keep vein open to make sure that the IV remains in place. And the medications that he normally takes will be held aside from clopidogrel and warfarin, and dobutamine will be added to ensure his blood pressure is corrected. For means of respiratory therapy, he'll be put on BiPAP at 16 over 6 with an FiO2 of 50%. For repeat diagnostic labs and procedures, what will be completed is only a serial troponin to see if that corrects with treatment. Interventional cardiology will be consulted for possible AICD placement and possible CRKD placement as well. And the patient will be advised of maybe a little bit of a blood pressure checkup, and then he'll be able to take a blood sample and then he'll be able to take a blood sample and then he'll be able to take a blood sample. Maintaining a healthy weight, weight reduction, keeping away from strenuous physical activity, and he will also be advised to stop smoking cigarettes if possible. All right."
" I just got finished seeing patient Leslie Palmer. She prefers to go by Ms. Palmer. She came in with a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. It started about two months ago. She's also having syncope, palpitations, dyspnea, orthopnea, and she also had an eight pound weight gain in her legs, mainly from the edema that she's experiencing. It's worse with physical activity. So she's an NYHA class three, but better with rest. She is sleeping in her recliner due to the fact that she is having orthopnea and not being able to breathe while she's laying down. She did have a cardiac catheterization 25 years ago, but they didn't find anything. Her father died when he was 59 years old from myocardial infarction and her mom at 40 from sudden death without known cause. She has not been hospitalized other than the cath. In terms of her medical condition, she has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams, daily and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. But she has no known drug allergies. In terms of her diet, she eats a balanced diet. She exercises daily, except she hasn't been able to for at least the past two months because of all of her current symptoms. She also does not use drugs, no tobacco, no alcohol, but does drink a cup of coffee daily. She's an elementary school teacher who's been married for 30 years and has a good support system with her spouse, who she lives with. In terms of her vital signs, her temperature looked good. Her heart rate was elevated. She had a good amount of blood pressure. She had a good amount of blood pressure. She had a good amount of blood pressure. Her blood pressure was 136 over 99, and her oxygen stats were 91%. So with that, I went ahead and admitted her into telemetry and diagnosed her with sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, a serious condition where I ordered for the nurses to check every two hours, and she could only come out of bed with assistance. In terms of instructions, strict INOs, daily weights, nasal cannula, and also maintaining 96% and also DVT prophylaxis with a low-sodium diet, KVO. In terms of her medications, I'm continuing to listen to Pearl because her blood pressure is still elevated. In terms of her prednisone, I am increasing the dose to 60 milligrams since it's an acute exasperation. I also added on IV furosemide to help get rid of the edema. And also, I added on amiodarone since I noticed that she was having a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on her EKG. In terms of lab work, I went ahead and ordered a CMP just since I put her on furosemide, and I've gone ahead and made consultations with an interventional cardiologist to come and look about AICD placement, as well as a radiologist, a nuclear radiologist for the FDG PET scan. Thank you."
" Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old female presenting with worsening shortness of breath. She had a cold two weeks ago that has improved but since then she has continued to have non radiating dull retro sternal chest pain and shortness of breath. Her activities have become limited due to her dyspnea and she has gained eight pounds in the past two weeks. She has been sleeping in a recliner due to our company. She has shortness of breath with any activity including walking across the room but her symptoms improve at rest. She has not had any fever for the past five days. Past medical history includes hypertension that she takes lisinopril for and she had a cardiac cath completed one year ago that was normal. She was evaluated by her PCP recently where she had a chest x ray that showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. She also had an echo that showed dilated cardiomyopathy with LVF at less than 30%. And an EKG that showed some sinus tachycardia with two beats of PVCs in the left bundle branch block. Lab work had elevated troponin of 0.1 and elevated BMP of 4,000. On vitals she had sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 and a pulse access of 91. She had a slightly elevated blood pressure of 130 over 90. On physical I had a JBB, wheezes, rails and pinning edema. For diagnosis I think she had somatocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. She had a heart attack. She had a heart attack. She had a mitopathy. So she's got a lot of things to work on. She's got a lot of things to work on. She has the cardiomyopathy secondary to her illness that she had two weeks ago. For the plan, currently to admit to telemetry, I'm going to start her on O2 nasal cannula for her low pulse ox. We're also going to order her lab work, serial troponin and CMP. I'd like to get a repeat 2D echo as well. For her medications, I'll have her continue on her lisinopril, order furosemide 40 IV for her edema, and also acetaminophen 6.5 for her pain. Referrals are going to for her to interventionally and for her heart surgery. refer her to interventional cardiology for evaluation of AICD, CRTD, and potential right ventricular biopsy. We're also going to send her to infectious disease for IVIG or glucocorticoids. And finally, radiology for an MRI of her chest with contrast."
" you a case presentation on a new patient. Ms. Palmers is a 62-year-old female presenting with a chief complaint of orthopnea and fatigue that started two months ago but has gotten worse the past three days. She has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams and presidendone 10 milligrams for. She has no allergies. She has gained eight pounds in the past two weeks, has dyspnea, palpitations, and sometimes has feelings of presynchro. She also mentioned swelling in her ankle. She had a cardiac catheter put in one year ago. Regarding her social history, she has a balanced diet, no alcohol, illicit drug, or tobacco use. She drinks one cup of coffee a day. She is currently sexually active and lives with her husband. She is generally active and walks with her friends regularly, but she has not been able to do that recently. Currently, she is NYHA class three with marked limitations of physical activity. Regarding her family, her mother is deceased and passed away from sudden death, and her father died at 59 due to myocardial infarction. Now, in regards to her vitals, temperature was 98.6, heart rate was 110, respiratory rate was 20, pulse was 108, blood pressure was 136 over 99, and oxygen level was 91%. Cardiopulmonary physical exam showed positive GVD, no carotid buoy, regular heart rate murmur, presence of gallop, presence of murmur, rails, and wheezing. She had pedal edema and DPPT pulses were full slash equal. Her labs showed elevated BNP at 4,000. X-ray showed normal heart size, pulmonary edema, and mediastinal fullness. Echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness with an ejection fraction at 55 percent, and EKG showed a low level of BNP at 55 percent. Her pulse was elevated with an ejection fraction at 55 percent, and EKG showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Home and sign testing for DVT was negative. So, at this point, sarcoidosis-restricted cardiomyopathy was suspected. So, I spoke to her about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about her social support and insurance. At this time, she will be admitted to telometry. Vitals will be taken every two hours, and activity instructions are out of bed with assistance. Nursing intervention includes strict I-O, daily weight, and daily weight. She will be admitted to the hospital every two hours, O2, two liters per minute via nasal cannula, DVT prophylaxis, and maintaining her oxygen saturation of about 96 percent. Diet is low, sodium, and KBO for fluid IVs. Medication will include presidone, 60 milligrams PO. She will continue taking her lisinopril, 10 milligrams PO, and we will add furosemide, 40 mg via IV every 12 hours. CMP was ordered. She will be consulted by interventional cardiologist and a radiologist for possible AICD placement and for FDG PET scan. Thank you so much."
" the ER today complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath for the last week or so. She notes that the fatigue and shortness of breath is much worse upon any type of exertion or just regular moving around. She also notes some orthopnea that is improved when she sits up and she actually prefers to sit in her recliner. The patient notes that approximately two and a half weeks ago, she had a cold, runny nose, fever, and some shortness of breath with a cough and also some fatigue. The patient has no significant history other than hypertension. Her surgical procedural history, she had a cardiac cath last year. Family history, her mom died of breast cancer. Dad is living with Alzheimer's. Social, she eats a balanced diet. She exercises two times a week, but ever since these symptoms began, she has not been able to exercise without significant shortness of breath. She does not use drugs, tobacco, alcohol. She does drink a cup of coffee every day, and she lives with her husband right now. Medications, she takes lisinopril, 10 milligrams for the hypertension, and she has no known allergies. Her review of symptoms, besides the fatigue, she denied today any fever, chills, weight loss, or weight gain. She had no rashes. She had no rashes. She had no rashes. She had no rashes. She had no rashes. Skin discoloration, lesions, or bruising. Musculoskeletal, patient noted some leg swelling, but denied any muscle aches, joint pain, back pain. Cardiovascular, she noted some chest pain and some palpitations, but denies any syncopal episodes. Pulmonary, she did have some orthopnea, and she noted some wheezing, and obviously, she had the discoloration. She had some chest pain, and she noted some chest pain, and some dyspnea. Neuro, patient had no complaints. She denied gait disturbances, dizziness, or confusion. HNT, she denied any neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, vision changes, hearing loss. And then, upon presentation today, her vital sign, her blood pressure was 130 over 90, temperature 98.6. She was tachycardic at 110, and her O2 set was 90.5. She had no symptoms, and her blood pressure was 91. Upon physical exam, she had jugular vein distension, cardiovascularly regular, no murmurs, no friction rub, no gallops. She did have a displaced PMI laterally. Lungs, to auscultation, I noted bivascular rails and wheezing. MSK1 plus pitting edema bilaterally in both lower extremities. Neurological exam was normal. So, today, we ordered troponin, BMP, EKG, chest x-ray, echo. Troponin was 0.1, which is mildly elevated. BMP was elevated at 4,000. EKG, she was sinus tachycardic at 100. There was a right bundle branch block, RSR, in the right leads. She had left axis deviation and premature ventricular contractions in AVR, AVL, AVF. Chest x-ray, there was pulmonary, edema, and cardiomegaly. Echo showed a dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction, less than 30%. So, I discussed this lab work and the imaging with the patient. I diagnosed her with myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and I discussed that it's probably related to the viral illness she had a few weeks ago. So, we're going to admit her to telemetry. She's going to see interventional radiation. She's going to see interventional radiation. She's going to see interventional radiation. She's going to see interventional radiation. She's going to see radiology for AICD placement and CRT. They might even want to do an endomyocardial biopsy. We'll also consult with infectious disease for immunoglobulin glucocorticoids, as well as radiology for contrast MRI. So, we're going to keep her on lisinopril, add acetaminophen for the pain, and we're going to get her on a furosemide, 40 milligrams IV. to get that fluid off. And then I discussed all the findings. I discussed the plan with the patient. We discussed the cause of the myocarditis, and I discussed the treatment options for her and told her that she's going to be in great hands."
" Palmer. Mr. Palmer walked into the ED today with a chief complaint of chest palpitations and difficulties when exercising. Mr. Palmer is currently being treated for hypertension with an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril, and his symptoms were onset during a bout of exercise, and Mr. Palmer states that he has no trouble when lying down, no trouble breathing when lying down. Some background history on Mr. Palmer is that he tries to walk every day until his symptoms, and he has a balanced diet. He drinks one cup of coffee a day, and some paths of relevant past family medical history include a myocardial infarction on his father's side. And a sudden death from his mother who died at a premature age of 40. And Mr. Palmer had mentioned that he had initially gone to his PCP to get some work done, and his PCP told him to come to the ED to have his symptoms further evaluated. He has been hospitalized in the past for a cath procedure, which came back okay, as he stated. And he has been hospitalized in the past for a cath procedure, which came back okay, as he stated. And he has been hospitalized in the past for a cath procedure, which came back okay, as he stated. And he also had an EKG at that time. And Mr. Palmer presented tired, fatigued, and weak, but he had no chest pain, only the palpitations, and he said that he almost had felt like as if he was going to faint sometimes, leading me to think of presyncope. And in addition to that during the review of systems, relevant findings on the pulmonary side included dyspnea, and during the physical exam, There was no fetal edema noted or pitting. And his PMI was displaced laterally. And during counseling, I went over all of his labs. And his labs included an x-ray showing cardiomegaly and a 2D echo showing septal growth in the myocardium of the heart. And an EKG indicating familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the growth in the septal waves. And for treatment, I counseled Mr. Palmer on discontinuing his lisinopril. And I think it's best to plan and administer a dosage of disapiramide. For him to help with his palpitations. And I would like to admit Mr. Palmer to telemetry for monitoring. And ultimately have him consulted by interventional cardiology in order to get an AICD placed. And cardiothoracic surgery to consult him on a potential septal myectomy and alcohol injection. And that essentially concludes my notes. On this patient encounter today. And relevant vitals. Encounter included an elevated heart rate. And an elevated blood pressure as well. And that concludes my patient."
" Ms. Palmer, a 62-year-old woman, came into the office. She was complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath. She is awake and alert and just seems fatigued. She says that she had a cold about two weeks ago, during which she experienced some chills, fever, coughing, and wheezing. She can't tolerate any physical activity, but however, the symptoms are better whenever she sleeps in her recliner. However, the symptoms are better when she sleeps in her recliner. Okay. Okay. Past medical history. She has hypertension. She takes the 10 milligrams of lisinopril for that. She has had no surgeries in the past. Her mother passed away of breast cancer at the age of 80, and her dad has Alzheimer's. Socially, she eats a well-balanced diet. Aside from the fatigue that she's starting to feel recently, she exercises twice a week. And um, she does not smoke any tobacco. She does not do any illicit drugs. She does not drink alcohol. She does drink caffeine. She's an elementary school teacher. And, she lives with her husband. For her review of symptoms, 2 weeks ago she complained that she admitted to having a fever. She does not have any chills. She said that she had gained weight ETF, and she feels fatigued. Her skin assessments were negative, but she complains of chest pains and palpitation and has no syncope. She also complains of reason and coughing and having to sleep in her chair. Her near exam was unimpressive, but she complains of myalgia. For her vital signs, she had a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, an O2 of 91 in room air, pulse of 110, and a respiration of 20. After asking her about her past medical history and assessing her vital signs with her, I went ahead and took a physical exam. The physical exam showed disbanded internal jugular. She had jugular vein distension. She had bifacilar rills and auscultation of her lungs. She also had pulmonary edema. There were no palpitations or irregular heartbeats. Her pulse was also present. The dorsalis pivis pulse was present, and they were strong. After the physical exam, we went ahead and reviewed her imaging. Her x-ray showed cardiomegaly. It also showed a fusion in the lungs, pulmonary edema. Her echo showed enlarged left ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction. Her EKG showed left axis tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions. It also showed a right bundle branch block. So for her diagnosis, I went ahead and diagnosed her with myocarditis, dilated myocarditis. I told her that the condition was serious and that we're going to admit her to telemetry. We are going to continue her on lisinopril, put her on flurisomide, and then acetaminophen for her chest pain. And then we're going to continue her on lisinopril, put her on flurisomide, and then acetaminophen for her chest pain. And then we're going to continue her on lisinopril, put her on flurisomide, and then acetaminophen for her chest pain. We're going to consult cardiology, interventional cardiology. We're also going to contact infectious diseases and then radiology as well. I ordered an ICD and glucocorticoids together with that as well. I asked if she had insurance. She confirmed that she had insurance and she had family support. I was going to help her through this time. So that's my case presentation on Ms. Palmer. Thank you, Doc."
" So the patient, Ms. Leslie Palmer, is a female patient who is 62 with chief complaint of dyspnea and fatigue. The patient mentioned that it has been going on for two weeks with cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, and chest pain. She also mentioned erythopoietic. Five days ago, the cough went away while the shortness of breath and fatigue had remained. She mentioned a past fever. The patient has no surgical history or hospitalization or allergies. She mentioned hypertension is taking lisinopril, 10 mg orally for that. She mentioned a balanced diet with exercise two times a week. However, due to her symptoms, she isn't able to exercise currently. She mentions no drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. And she mentions drinking coffee about a cup a day. She's an elementary school teacher and sexually active with her husband. The patient is up to date with immunization. And she reports other symptoms such as arrhythmia, wheezing, swelling, and says she's sleeping on a recliner indicating orthopnea. So that's the patient. So physical exam was performed. So lung and heart oscillations were performed. And OMM was performed as well with the focus of heart changes, spinal examination, and tissue tenderness. Homan's test was also performed. There was jugular venous distension, no bruise, regular heart rate, no chest wall tenderness. There were rails and wheezing present during physical exam. And there was pitting edema as well. The heart rate was 110. Oxygen was 91. Blood pressure was 130 over 90. And respiratory rate was 20. The chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. And the echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. The troponin, the lab showed troponin was high at 0.1. And BNP was high at 4,000. And on EKG, it showed a right bundle branch block with sinus attack and left axis deviation. All the labs and images were explained individually to the patient. The diagnosis made was myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy. And this explains the patient. For orders, patient will be admitted to telemetry for serious condition. And vitals will be taken every two hours. Strict IO daily weight and DVT prophylaxis with O2 nasal cannula and O2 stack greater than 96% will be recommended. A low-sodium diet would be recommended. Also, the sinopril will be continued at 10 milligram. Cetaminophen will be. Added at 625 milligram orally. And furosemide IV at 40 milligram will also be added. A repeat of echo will be ordered as well as a repeat of troponin and CMP. There will be referral to interventional cardiology for AID and CRTD. And infectious disease for immune globulin. And also radiology for immediate enhanced MRI. And all these were explained. The diagnosis, imaging, and next steps were explained to the patient. And that concludes my case presentation. Thank you."
" presenting Mr. Leslie Palmer's case. Mr. Leslie Palmer was a patient in room 11 at our emergency room today. Mr. Palmer presented to the emergency department as a 62-year-old male who came to the ED due to feeling short of breath for the last six months. Mr. Palmer stated that he felt sore all over and couldn't participate in any exercise without feeling short of breath or feeling tired in general. Mr. Palmer also stated that he had a lower extremity edema bilaterally, as well as only feels comfort at rest in the semi-fowler position. Mr. Palmer, his past medical history consists of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His past surgery was performed on a patient who was in a state of acute heart disease. Mr. Palmer has no known allergies and takes numerous medications such as astorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metroprol 6-in-8, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. Mr. Palmer lives at home. He's married. He currently lives with his wife. Upon physical exam, Mr. Palmer displayed JVD, laterally displaced PMI, laterally displaced PMI, RAILS, pedal edema, as well as cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on checks to x-ray. Mr. Palmer's EKG consists of normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. Mr. Palmer also had a left bundle branch block, as well as met left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. He also, his lab work, displayed elevated troponin as well as BNP. With this said, Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. His echo also showed this and supported this with a dilated ventricle, as well as thinned septum. He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and evaluation by interventional cardiology. Mr. Palmer's diagnosis warranted vitals every two hours, a strict bed rest, nursing, and a strict bed rest. Mr. Palmer was diagnosed with a severe steroid lastly following an incentivized treatment, along with an angiogram initialized in the mid-30 day. The합니다 did not touch his poker longependent recovery meditation. Diagnosed fairies."
" All right. Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old woman who presents to the ER today complaining of dyspepnea ongoing for six months and worsening in the last three days.

Her 2D echo reveals dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30. She has elevated troponin. She has elevated BMP. I diagnosed her with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and I admitted her to the ICU and placed her on a BiPAP. I ordered an IV to keep the veins open. I continued her on clopidrogel and warfarin for devain thrombosis prophylaxis. I kept her on furosemide. However, I should have placed her on dobutamine. She is on strict bed rest. I ordered follow-up labs of the PT slash PTT INR and serial troponins. I consulted an interventional. cardiologist for AICD and CRT slash D placement."
" All right. Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension who presents at the referral of his primary care provider for approximately two weeks of dyspnea on exertion with accompanying fatigue and wheezing. He states that his symptoms only present with exercise and are relieved by rest. He explicitly states that his shortness of breath improves with lying down. Leslie also mentions a presyncopal sensation with exercise and heart palpitations. He denies experiencing a syncopal episode, only feeling like he may pass out. He describes his palpitations as a fluttering and speeding up of his heart. He denies any chest pain, any lower extremity edema, or any recent changes in his weight. He says he's compliant with his lisinopril 10 milligrams. He notes a cardiac cath approximately one year ago, which was normal. He says his father died of a heart attack at the age of 59, and his mother died suddenly at the age of 40. He has no known drug allergies, and he denies tobacco and alcohol use. He also denies illicit drug use. He says he drinks about one cup of coffee a day and has a balanced diet with minimal salt intake, or addition of salt, I should say. He is employed as a teacher and lives at home with his wife. He says before his symptoms begin, he was walking a few days per week, but is unable to exercise with his symptoms now. On physical exam, he does have a systolic murmur with an S4 and gallop. He has no chest wall tenderness, no JVD, no carotid bruise, no abdominal bruise. His PMI is laterally displaced. He has lungs are cleared to auscultation bilaterally. His calves are non-tender, no pedal edema, negative home. He has strong and equal DP and PT pulses. Chest x-ray was significant for cardiomegaly, but otherwise normal. His echo showed interventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and tall R waves in the septal leads. Troponin was negative, and BMP was within normal limits. I told him that he most likely has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and that we'd like to admit him to the hospital. I said he'd be started on diisopuramide for arrhythmia control, and that we'd also like to consult interventional cardiology for possible placement of an AI CD, and we'd also talk to cardiothoracic surgery about a possible septomyomectomy or alcohol injection. He seemed to understand the plan. He noted he does have insurance to help cover the cost of his treatment. I said that's a good idea, and I said, okay, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. of his hospital stay."
" The 62-year-old female patient presents the ED with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reports gradual worsening of shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling like passing out over the past two months. She visited her primary care physician three weeks ago where tests were conducted, but her symptoms continued to worsen. Symptoms improved with rest but worsened with physical activity. The patient mentioned sleeping on a chair at night to alleviate the symptoms. The patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. She currently takes lisinopril 10 mg and prednisone 10 mg. She does not have any known allergies and she does not use any substances such as tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She does. She has a daily daily dose of 1 cup of coffee per day. The patient reports a balanced diet, exercise regularly, but much less since her symptoms started. She works as an elementary school teacher, is in a modern relationship, and has insurance and also support at home. On physical examination, the patient appeared well-developed, well-nourished, fatigued, awake, and orient. Notable findings include elevated jugular vein distension, a systolic murmur, and one plus pitting edema of the lower extremities. BMP was elevated at 400-4000. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and medial spinal fullness. Echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with a 55% injection fraction. The EKG was suggested of a non-sustained VTAC with normal sinus rhythm. Overall, the patient was in a good condition. The patient was in a good condition. The patient was in a good condition. Overall, the 60-year-old male, female, with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension, presenting worsening shortness of breath, palpitations, near-fainting episodes, demonstrating signs of volume overload, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. So for her plan, we decided to admit her for telemetry with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and three on the NYHA scale, Considering the searness of her condition, there was no non-drug allergies to be noted and vitals were to be closely monitored at two hours. The patient will be encouraged to engage in mobility with assistance. Nursing instructions are strict intake-outtake monitoring, daily weight measurements, DVT prophylaxis, and the use of oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation over 96%. The patient will be placed on a low-sodium diet. To manage fluid retention, IV fluids will be administered via saline. The patient will be locked to keep vein open rate. Medications will be continued as previously described, including ricinopril, 10 mg QD, and additional medication will be initiated, such as imiodrone, 150 mg IV, and an increase in prednisone to 16 mg QD, and furosemide IV, 40 mg. A comprehensive metabolic manner will be applied. The patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet. The patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet. Consultation with interventional cardiology will be made for consideration of an AICD placement and a consultation with nuclear medicine radiology will be arranged for a FGE PET scan. To further evaluate the sarcoid, the patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet. To further evaluate the sarcoid, the patient will be advised to maintain a healthy diet.

" So Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension on 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily, and she's presenting to the emergency department today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. She states that two weeks ago she had a cough, a fever, and a runny nose, along with her current symptoms, and she says that those all subsided about five days ago, but the ones that are currently presenting are still persisting through. Her chest pain is described as being substernal, constant, and dull, and it doesn't radiate anywhere else. Nothing seems to specifically aggravate it, but she has also not tried any medications, but she does note that reclining back makes her symptoms a little better. Her current pain level is a 2 out of 10, and she feels that her chest pain is at rest, which would classify her as an NYHA of 4. Her only surgical history is a cardiac catheterization. She has been diagnosed with a heart attack and a heart failure about a year ago that showed no obstructive coronary artery disease, and she has no known drug allergy. She doesn't smoke, drink, or do any illicit substances at all. She works as an elementary school teacher, and her family history is positive for a mom who passed away from breast cancer at the age of 80, and her current father is 89, and he's in the nursing home for Alzheimer's right now. She states she eats a well-balanced diet, and she was exercising, but she's not feeling well. She was exercising two times a week for about an hour at a time, but she hasn't been able to given her current symptoms. She drinks a cup of coffee a day, and she's currently married and lives in a stable household with her husband of 30 years, and she's still sexually active with just her husband and only her husband. Her vitals at the consultation were a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. Her respiratory rate was a 20, and her temperature was a 20. Her blood pressure was a 20, and her heart rate was a 90. Her respiratory rate was a 20, and her temperature was a 20. Her heart rate was a 20. Her heart rate was a 20. Her temperature was at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. On the review of systems, she was positive for fatigue and recent weight gains of 8 pounds. She noted palpitations and chest pain with no syncope. She also noted wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, and some lower extremity edema. Her physical exam showed jugular vein distension with no carotid brewies. Her heart rate was regular with no murmur, friction rubs, or any gallops. or any gallops. On palpitation of her PMI, it was noted to be laterally displaced, and her lungs were positive for bibasilar rails and wheezing. She also had one plus heading edema in her lower extremity, but she also had a negative Hohmann sign, and pulses were full and equal bilaterally as well. On the imaging that was done upon entering the ER today, her chest x-ray showed that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Her echo was interpreted by the radiologist and was found to have a dilated left ventricle, an ejection fraction of 30%. Her EKG showed that she had sinus tachycardia with about 100 beats per minute on that and a right bundle branch block, and there were also a few captured preventricular contractions as well. Her lab showed a troponin of 0.1 and a BNP of 4,000, and given the history of her physical exam and diagnostic exams that were done, a diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy was made. The treatment plan for Mrs. Palmer was to admit her to telemetry, take vitals every two hours, and have the nurses monitor her ins and outs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and bring her oxygen up with an O2 nasal cannula, trying to get her SATs over 96%. We should keep her on a diet low in sodium, and have her restricted on oral fluid intake. She will also be on an IV fluid saline lock KVO. She was instructed to continue taking her lisinopril while in the hospital and thereafter, and will also add on some acetaminophen 625 every six hours by mouth and furosemide 40 milligrams IV, and also a beta blocker metobrolol succinate 50 milligrams by mouth while she's in the hospital. Additionally, we're going to get repeat labs with serial troponin, and a 2D echo during her stay here. We also consulted interventional cardiology for a CRTD and potential AICD placement, and also a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted as well, just for potential immunoglobin and glucocorticoid treatment if they deem it necessary. And then lastly, the radiologist was consulted for a potential media enhanced MRI if they also deem that necessary. Overall, Mrs. Palmer expressed no concerns with being admitted to the hospital or to the treatment plan moving forward."
" Today I'm presenting patient Ms. Palmer, who is a pleasant but somewhat fatigued appearing 62-year-old female patient with a chief complaint of fatigue, shortness of breath, and dull chest pain, which began about two weeks ago. She states she just had some fever, cough, and runny nose when her symptoms began and believed that she just had a cold. She continued to exercise, believing she just had the common cold, but noticed she was unable to complete her exercises due to shortness of breath and fatigue, which was unusual for her. Ms. Palmer states her symptoms have been constant since her onset, and nothing has made it better, but notices that exercise can make it worse. She has tried nothing medically for her symptoms and rates their severity as a 2 out of 10 today. Regarding her medical history, she did have a cardiac cath about a year ago and does have a history of hypertension. She has no allergies. She exercised about two to three times a week before her symptoms began and was unable to do so since. She does not use any drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. She does drink about one cup. She does not drink coffee per day. She currently does work as an elementary school teacher and lives comfortably at home with her husband. She has no prior history of hospitalizations. She mentions no family history when inquired. She is currently taking Lysanthrope 10mg periorally daily for her hypertension. Her general review of systems revealed no fever or chills today, although they did occur two weeks ago when her symptoms began. She does have fatigue today as well as an 8-pound weight gain. Her skin, ROS, is negative. Her head, eye, ears, nose, and throat ROS is also negative. Her cardio ROS reveals some dull chest pain today accompanied by palpitations but no presyncope. Pulmonary ROS does have shortness of breath, wheezing, and has been sleeping on a recliner due to her orthopnea. Her MSK ROS reveals some mild muscle aches in her lower legs as well as noticeable swelling in her lower extremities. Her neuro ROS is negative. She is otherwise well-developed and well-nourished, albeit with a slight increase in her blood volume. She is also a very active person. She is also a very active person. She is also a very active person despite her early mm and acne. She has pain<|ro|> to Currently insane for all sports. So true, so true. Her abdomen was also soft and non-tender, and there were no tart changes noticed. Her vitals were normal, except for a mild tachycardia of 110 and her respiratory rate of 20, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and O2 set of 91 today. Her labs, including chest x-ray, which revealed some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, her EKG, which revealed some right bundle branch block and sinus tachycardia, and her 2D echo, which revealed 30% injection fraction and dilated cardiomyopathy, her blood work revealed troponin slightly elevated and BMP of 4,000 and slightly elevated. This was reviewed with the patient, and a primary diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy NYHA class 2 was made given her presentation. We plan to admit her to med with telemetry. Her condition is currently serious. Vitals are to be taken every two hours, and her activity levels can be managed as tolerated. Nursing was instructed to manage strict input-output, daily weight changes, DVT prophylaxis, as well as O2 bionase. Her O2 saturation is to be maintained above 96%. She is also recommended to have a low-sodium diet, and perioral fluid restriction is recommended at this time. IV fluids are to be locked, and the veins are to be kept open. She has no allergies. Acetaminophen 625mg periorally every six hours is recommended to help with her inflammation, and she is to continue her Leisodonopril as previously prescribed of 10mg every day. We are to add furosemide 40mg IV every 12 hours to her. We will repeat serotroponin and get a CMP as she is now on furosemide. She was referred to interventional cardiology for AIC placement, as well as CRTD, and a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted for referral for immune globulin, as well as glucocorticoids to further reduce the swelling. Radiology consult for contrast media enhanced MRI was also recommended to detect for further myocardial inflammation. She was recommended to maintain a healthy weight and to reduce her weight, and no strain or physical activity is to be recommended at this time. Patient had no further questions and was satisfied with her diagnosis and treatment plan."
" Thank you. Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male in room two. He arrived at the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue, just constant fatigue. He said these symptoms gradually got worse over the past six months. And he made an appointment with his primary care physician about three days ago, and the physicians recommended him to check himself in at the emergency room. He did not complain of any chest pain. He did mention that his legs have been swollen, likely due to lower extremity edema. Mr. Palmer also said that he gained about eight pounds recently. And that he's been getting wheezes and shortness of breath while sleeping. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He's also had triple bypass and a lower left ascending artery stent. And so his breathing has been pretty good over the last three years. He is now getting a number two heart��서. He has aolie title, and has no joint injury history in his entire life. Walk site. I met Mr. Palmer about a year ago. Mr. Palmer has of ис talent family history related to his present illness. And so Mr. Palmer used to walk with his friends often, But now due to is fatigue, over the less six months, And I was going to refer him to a specialist who can help with that, help him quit. As of right now, he's currently taking the following medications. He's taking warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, and metapropyl succinate. And he has no known drug allergies. His vital signs are as follows. His blood pressure is 80 over 50, which is a little hypertensive. Temperature is normal at 98.6. His SpO2 is 86, which is also low. And his heart rate is normal at 90 beats per minute. Upon physical exam, Mr. Palmer had JVD, heart gallop, lung wheezes, and rails were also present. He also had pulmonary cirrhosis. He had a lot of pulmonary edema in his lower extremities, like he mentioned before. And he did not have any chest wall tenderness upon palpation. After the physical exam, I told him he most likely has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as a secondary diagnosis of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. For admission, we'll have to admit him to the ICU upon serious conditions. We'll have to take his vitals every two hours. And he'll have to be on strict bed rest with little to no physical activity. The nurses will intervene with strict IOs, daily weights, DBT prophylaxis, as well as BiPAP. We'll put him on a low-sodium diet, since he has no food allergies as well. I will order troponin and PT-INR. We'll have to make sure his IV stays open, and refer him to an interventional cardiologist for an AICD. And we'll have him continue his warfarin and clopidogrel, but as well we'll add on an insulin sliding scale and dopamine IV drip. Thanks so much."
" Mr. Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old male who presents to the clinic today to the emergency room with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, and near syncope. The patient states that he began his symptoms about two weeks ago, and he went to his family medicine doctor because he was a little concerned. And his family medicine doctor ordered some tests, but the patient did not get any of his tests back. However, yesterday, the patient noticed that his symptoms were worsening, so he decided to come to the ER. Upon presentation, the patient states that he has trouble with some physical activity. He has... He has some trouble with physical activity, and he also states that his symptoms do get better upon rest. The patient states that he, in terms of severity, he states that while he's sitting, his severity is zero, but with any brief... Okay. I'm going to start over. All right. All right. So I'm going to start over. Hi, Dr. Rollins. This is student Dr. Akshata Sastry, and I'll be presenting the case for Mr. Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old male. And he presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and near syncope. The patient states that he has had his symptoms for about two weeks. And the patient reports that... The patient reports that he visited his family medicine doctor about two weeks ago... About a few days ago, concerned about his symptoms. And the PCP decided to run some tests, but the patient has not received those back yet. The patient notes that he had an increase in symptoms. And the PCP says that he had an increase in symptoms yesterday, and that's why he decided to come to the ER. The patient states that his symptoms began about two weeks ago. He states that they are better at rest, so he does not have any severity or any symptoms when he is at zero. However, he says that with some physical activity, he does have his symptoms, which made me believe that he was at a New York scale of two. The patient states that his symptoms... He did not radiate anywhere, and he did not treat with any medication because he did not know any of them. His medical history states that he... The patient, Mr. Palmer, states that he had a cardiac cath body a year ago. And his medical history... For hypertension. The patient states he also did not have any allergies. In terms of his social history, the patient is... Eats a very... He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He eats a lot. He is sexually active with his wife. Upon the ROS, patient denies all symptoms except for his fatigue, his shortness of breath, some wheezing, and some palpitations, and of course his presyncopal episodes. And I decided to start the physical exam at that point. I did not know any carotid bruise. I decided to listen to his, and I did not notice any chest tenderness. When I listened to his... I listened to his heart. I did notice an S3, S4 murmur as well as a gallop. I listened to his lungs, and they were clear bilaterally to auscultation. I decided to also check for any abdominal bruise and abdominal masses, and that was negative. He did not have any peripheral edema. He did not have any calf asymmetry, no Hohmann signs. And the patient... Yeah. And his pulses were very strong. I decided to get... Look at his vitals, and his vitals did look a little bit high. His heart rate was at 110, and his saturation was about 96%, which was okay. His respiration rate was about 16 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was 130 over 90. Looking at his labs, I noticed his CMP, his troponin, and his BNP were all normal, within normal values. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%. And his EKG demonstrated tall R-waves in all the septal leaves, some left ventricular hypertrophy, but other than that, normal sinus rhythm and normal access. For admission, I decided to diagnose him with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, because he did state that his family... Oh, he also told me that he... In terms of his family, his mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40, and his father passed away from a myocardial infarction. So due to his history, I decided, and along with his physical exam, I decided that he has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... He has a... I decided that he would... He needs to be switched off his lisinopril that he takes for his hypertension, and instead be put on diisoparamide. And then I would like to admit him to the hospital, to telemetry. I would like the nurses to be watching it for ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis. I would like to have his daily weight watched, and I'd like... I'd like to put him on a nasal cannula at two liters, and keep him above 96% because of his complaint on shortness of breath. In terms of people I would like to... The doctors I'd like to consult with him, I would like an interventional cardiologist to come see him for his AICD, and I'd also like a cardiothoracic surgeon to come see him for evaluation if he needs a septal myectomy or alcohol injection. And that is the conclusion of my case presentation. Thank you."
" After a family med consult, her family doctor ordered some tests because he was concerned about her six-month duration dyspnea. The patient noted that the dyspnea gets better only when she lays in the recliner. She hasn't tried anything to make it better, and nothing that she tried made it better. She rated the breathing that she would experience a 9 out of 10 on the worst exertion. As far as her medical history is concerned, she had high blood pressure, high cholesterol. She was diabetic, and five years ago, she was diagnosed with AFib. On her father's side, he is in a nursing home currently, 89 years old. On her mother's side, she died of breast cancer. She has no allergies to medication. She had a stent put in last June. Aside from that, she had five stents put in total, and she had a triple bypass done. No hospitalizations. She had a list of medications that I inputted into the EMR. She has a balanced diet, exercises daily, doesn't take any drugs or alcohol, still smokes. I counsel the patient about quitting the smoking. She doesn't smoke. She has one pack a day. She drinks one cup of coffee a day. She's currently still an elementary school teacher, and she has a partner that was sitting in the waiting room, who she's married to for 30 years with no kids. As far as her vitals are concerned, her heart rate was 90. Her blood pressure was 80 over 50. Respiratory rate 22. Pulse 90. Temperature 98.6. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. Left bundle branched. She had a block and left axis deviation. Her lab results showed elevated troponin and BMP, indicative of cardiac muscle cell death and heart failure, or what I said to the patient was heart dysfunction. As far as her view of systems is concerned, she had orthopnea. She had difficulty breathing at rest. So that puts her at an NYHA level. She had a score of 4. She had fatigue, wheezing. Every other ROS for MSK and neuro GI was negative or otherwise noted in the EMR. I didn't have a chance to copy it over onto my sheet. She is immunized or up to date on all her immunizations. So we went ahead and I gave her a consult as far as her needing to be admitted to the ICU. The nurses will receive instructions regarding vitals to be checked every two hours. Strict bed rest. Also strict monitoring of intake outtake, daily weights. DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet. IV, KVO. She would need BiPAP. We would discontinue all her medications, which I let her know. And add the butamine for her blood pressure. I did not have any symptoms. I didn't let the patient know that we would need to put her on an insulin scale, but I think that's what's necessary to know for the nursing staff. And she would continue taking Plavix and Warfarin. She would need to get repeat labs for troponins and PTI and R because she's currently taking Warfarin. As far as consult, I let the patient know that she would need a consult to interventional cardiology for CRT and AICD. Specifically, she would need a CT scan. I don't know if she's already done that. So I'm not sure. But I'm sure she's going to be able to get her done. So I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Specifically because of the left bundle branch blocking me to reestablish some normal rhythm in her heart. That's it."
" doing a case presentation on Leslie Palmer. The patient is Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old male. He presents to the office with shortness of breath and fatigue. He states that he saw his GP three days ago and was referred to the ER today. The patient states his symptoms started two weeks ago with heart palpitations that worsen with exercise and improve with rest. He also states near syncope. He denies fevers, chills, and changes in weight. He denies joint pain, muscle pain, and back pain. He also denies skin changes. He denies vision changes and hearing loss and neck stiffness. He notes some dizziness with the heart palpitations when he's exercising. Past medical history includes hypertension and is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He denies a surgical history. Set for a cardiac catheterization that was normal. Family history includes his mother, who passed away suddenly decades ago, and his father also passed away at age 59 due to MI. He has no known drug allergies. For his social history, he states that he eats a well-balanced diet and walks daily. He denies use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. He drinks a cup of coffee every morning and is an elementary school teacher for fifth grade. He's also sexually active. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 110, which is slightly elevated, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, which is also slightly elevated, but he is taking lisinopril, a respiratory rate of 16, his temperature was 98.6, and his O2 sat was 96%. Fiscal exam showed negative GVD and bruise. There was an S4 murmur and gallop and a laterally displaced PNR. PMI. Lungs were equal to exquiltation bilaterally. No lower extremity edema or calf tenderness, and pulses were present, equal, and bilateral. Labs showed troponin and BMP within normal limits. A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. Echo showed LVH voltage criteria and tall R waves and septal leads. Patient was diagnosed with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Due to genetics, the treatment plan for this patient is to omit two telemetry, maintain activities tolerated, strict IO, daily weight, DVT, prophylaxis, and O2 nasal cannula to maintain the O2 sat at 96%. He can have a regular diet and would do a Saini mock or KVO. Patient is to discontinue the lisinopril and start disopiramide, 100 milligrams BID. No further labs and imaging needed. We will consult with the doctor. We will consult with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement, and we'll consult with a cardiothoracic surgeon for a future septal myomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce the LVOT. Patient to lose weight or maintain healthy weight, and not do strenuous activity until released by the physician. Thank you for your time."
" left the emergency department after seeing Ms. Leslie Palmer. She is a 62-year-old female who's presenting with symptoms of progressive worsening of shortness of breath and fatigue over the last two months. She said she saw her family doctor about three days ago where she received a diagnostic workup but did not get to review the labs and diagnostic findings with her PCP. She said she presents today because her symptoms have worsened. She says that she has significant decreases in her activity levels, no longer able to complete her normal activity. Patient has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she reports confines with her medications of lisinopril and prednisone, reports a maternal history of sudden death of her mother around 40 years, and paternal history of death at 59 following a MI. She has no known drug allergies. She reports an outpatient cath procedure about one year ago, no complications from that. Her associated symptoms that she's been seeing with today is about eight pounds weight gain in the last two weeks. Fatigue, as I said. She notes some presyncope as well as palpitations, no chest pain though, associated wheezing, and orthopnea where she says she's now having to lay in her chair to sleep. She has no rheumatoid arthritis. Her fy grenta festering raises her blood pressure by 10%, which is a colocaaaaaand steadiness Digital murmur with no rubs or gallops. PMI was not displaced. Wheezes were present and rails were present. She had no tenderness, was not in acute respiratory distress though. Homan's was negative, no untender calves. She did have pedal edema, one plus. Her pulses were all present. Looking at her x-ray, she had mediastinal fullness, pulmonary edema, as well as a normal heart size. I discussed this all with the patient as well as going over her echo, which was read as restrictive cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction at 95 or 55%, excuse me. Her EKG, it seemed normal, maybe an occurrence of some left ventricular hypertrophy was a little elevated in the V5, V6 leads. Told her it could have been maybe something we want to repeat on the EKG at a we talked about that as well with the patient. Her troponin as well as her CBC and CMP were within normal limits, non-diagnostic, but she did have an elevated BMP at 4,000. So I discussed with the patient that I believe that her pulmonary sarcoidosis history, that was about 25 years ago, has likely spread to her heart and is causing her symptom presentation. Currently, I would pull the patient on the plan to get admitted to telemetry and where we'll get the results. I would pull the patient on the plan to get admitted to telemetry and where we'll get consults with interventional cardiology as well as radiology to further evaluate and work up this patient. Told her about potential for getting a pacemaker placed as well as to get further imaging with the radiologist. Went through the plans and how she'll be admitted. She says she has insurance and good social support locally. So she felt good about that plan to get admitted and have people who would support her. We talked about how she's going to get some medication. She said she's going to get some medication. She said she's going to get some medication to support her symptoms, try to help alleviate them. So I'm going to go ahead and prescribe her some amiodarone for the non-sustained VTAC as well as Lacinopril. I'm going to up her prednisone dosage since the pulmonary sarcoidosis has seemingly spread to her heart. I'm also going to get some frosemide to help the pulmonary edema that she's experiencing. And I'm going to do a repeat CMP just to make sure that the that nothing has changed from that."
" our patient Leslie. She is a 62-year-old female, Leslie Palmer. She came into the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. She stated this started about two weeks ago when she first had flu-like symptoms, and they seemed to go away around five days ago, but ever since that moment, she has been quite tired and fatigued, especially, she said, when she goes to the gym, she's not able to do any strenuous activity, so having some exertion with dyspnea. She also states that she seems to have a dull, constant pain on her chest, and the only way to make it feel better, especially during the night, is to put some put some pillows in the back or sit on the recliner, so it seems like she's got some orthopnea going along with the dyspnea. Then, she didn't take any medications in the past. The only thing that makes it feel better is just resting. I do want to see, I did want to go over also her past medical history. She does seem to have a history of hypertension. She was taking lisinopril, 10 milligrams. She stated she had no allergies, but she has had some prior procedures before. She had a cardiac cath about a year ago due to some abnormal EKGs, but everything came up okay, she stated. Other pertinent history, her mom, she died of breast cancer, and her dad currently is nine years old with dementia. In addition to that, social factors, she usually exercises a lot of exercise, two to three days a week, so she is active and eats a balanced, well, diet, so it is a little on the stranger side that she has, she's had shortness of breath while trying to exercise. She is a teacher and is married and sexually active as well. When I did the review of systems, I did get some pertinent information when it came to general. She complained of fatigue, some gain of weight. She did have a fever and chills in the past, but not currently. Then skin was normal. Heant was normal. Then cardiac RRS, she did have palpitations and chest pain. And with lungs, she said she complained of shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea, and some wheezing as well. She did also complain that she had fluid in her extremities. And other than that, her vitals, they were 130 over 90. Heart rate was 110. Temperature was 98.6. Rescuerization rate was 20. Oxygen saturation was 91%. And mean arterial pressure, 103. When it comes to the physical exam itself, she was not a very positive person. She was not a very positive person. She was not a very positive person. She was not a very positive person. She was not a very positive person. She was not a very positive person. She did have a jugular vein distension. In regards to cardiovascular problems, she did have her TMI was displaced laterally. No murmurs, friction rub, or gallops. There did seem to be some rails present as well, the wheezes. And in regards to her edema, she did have some fetal edema. She also had her pulses and her dorsalis pedis were equal bilateral. Her x-ray did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, which was explained to her. It did show some dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction as well. And her EKG showed some sinus tachy with left ventricular hypertrophy. And probably a right bundle branch block. Her troponin was elevated. BMP was 4,000. As a whole, she was diagnosed with myVEL dilated cardiomyopathy due to the prior history. And with congestive heart failure, her New York Heart Association score was a three due to I'm sorry, was it two, as she had limitation only with strenuous physical activity. She was admitted for telemetry. This is a serious case. We wanted to keep her vitals every two hours. Activity is tolerated. Nursing interventions included daily weights, O2, cannula, maintaining O2 status of 96%, and DBT prophylaxis, strict intake and output. We wanted to keep the vein open. In regards to medication, we are allowing for acetaminophen 625 milligrams every six hours as needed. Then we have metoprolol and lisinopril, which were prescribed. So lisinopril 10 milligrams every day, and then the 50 milligrams by mouth every day of metoprolol, along with furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 12 hours. Additional labs included serotroponins, and then also repeat 2D echo to take a look at the heart and monitor progress. She was referred to interventional cardiology, infectious anesthesiologists, and radiology for possible AICD placement, CRTD placement, endomyocardial biopsy. Media-enhanced MRI and immune globulin or glucocorticoids, possibly, but that will be something the specialists will be taking care of. Thank you."
" presenting to you today a 62-year-old female patient, Leslie Palmer, who showed up today to the ER with chief complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations that started two months ago, which has been getting worse. Patient stated to have visited her family medicine provider three days ago, but since then her symptoms haven't gotten any better, and I would classify her as a NYHA classification of three. Patient stated that she had fatigue and gained eight pounds since the start of her symptoms. Patient also stated that she had wheezing, orthopnea, and dyspnea with exertion. For her cardiovascular symptoms, she stated that she had palpitations, presyncope, but no chest pain. Her musculoskeletal symptoms were all negative except for swelling in her lower extremities. Otherwise, everything else was insignificant for her ROS. The patient has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis that was diagnosed 25 years ago. The patient had a cardiac cath done a year ago with no significant results, otherwise no other hospitalizations. Patient has no known allergies. She stated that she had a balanced diet, used to walk every day with friends, but was unable to nowadays due to her symptoms. She's not taking any illicit drugs, no Depak, no tobacco or alcohol. She drinks a cup of coffee every day and is an elementary school teacher. She's also married and has someone to take care of her throughout her medical care, and she has insurance. Her patient died suddenly at the age of 40, and her father died of a heart attack at the age of 59. For her physical exam, I noted a positive jugular venous distension, but no carotid bruise, no rashes, no petechiae, no purpura. By basilar reels and wheezing, point of maximum impulse was normal with no chest wall tenderness. She had a positive one pitting lower extremity edema and had a full and equal posterior tibial pulses. Her calf was non-tender. Her heart was regular with a systolic murmur of S4, no pericardial friction rub, but positive for gallops. She had a heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20. Blood pressure of 136 over 99. Pulse was 108, and her temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. For her lab, she only had elevated BMP levels. Chest x-ray showed infiltration in her lungs, a widened mediastinum, and a normal-sized heart. The echo results showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus and access with a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and she will be admitted to the hospital. The patient will be continuing her lisinopril, 10 mg. I increased her prednisone to 60 mg, and then I added amiodarone, 150 mg IV, and furosemide, 40 mg IV. I will be ordering CMP labs for her, and I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an IV. I will also be consulting AICD placement and radiology for a FUG PET scan. Patient will also be given oxygen via the nasal cannula to maintain her oxygen saturation above 96%. And I counseled the patient on maintaining a low-sodium diet and not getting out of bed without assistance. Thank you. Thank you."
" case presentation on the patient that I just saw, Ms. Leslie. So she went to her PCP about three days ago, complaining of shortness of breath, tiredness, fluttering in her heart, as well as some feelings of about to pass out. She didn't actually pass out, so bracing can be feelings. Her PCP told her if anything got worse to come see us. And he also ordered her x-ray, labs, echo, and EKG. So we're going to go over those with her. I went over them with her. Sorry, three, two, one, go. Hi, Dr. Rawlins. This is Dr. Drew McCauley. I just want to give you a case presentation on the patient I just saw, Ms. Leslie. So she went to her PCP about three days ago with complaints of shortness of breath, tiredness, flutterings in her heart, as well as precinct can be feelings. Her doctor went ahead and ordered labs, chest x-ray, echo, and EKG. And we're going to go over those with her. So we're going to go over those with her. We're going to go over those results with the patient today, which is what I did. And she came to the ED as instructed by her doctor as her symptoms were getting worse. So this all began about two months ago. And she is no longer able to do really any activity without the pain, sorry, not the pain, her symptoms getting worse. She likes to sit in her recliner, as well as rest to help with her symptoms. She says that it gets worse when she's laying flat, as well as being moving in any sort of activity. Her past medical history consists of high blood pressure and pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed 25 years ago. She had a cardiac cath one year ago, no complications, nothing significant from that. My family medical history for her mom was sudden death at 40, and her father died with a heart attack at 59. Her social history, she does not use alcohol, not use tobacco, never uses drugs, never has before. She is currently employed as a fourth grade teacher, cup of coffee. She used to exercise regularly five times a week with a walking group of her friends, but due to her symptoms, she's no longer able to do that. She is living with her husband. She currently takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, as well as pregnazone 10 milligrams once a day for sarcoidosis, lisinopril is for her high blood pressure. She has no drug allergies. She does have an unexplained weight gain of about eight pounds over the past two weeks. Her RRS for skin and HE and T were both negative. For her cardiovascular, we talked about her palpitations, which she's been experiencing, and she also has had the feelings of presyncope, like we already talked about. For pulmonary, she has been having some wheezing, as well as the dips in orthopnea. For MSK, she's had the lower extremity edema, and she's had some lightheadedness feeling. Today, she presented awake, alert, and oriented. Her vital signs were as follows. Temperature was 98.6, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 136 every 90, SpO2 91%. Carotid, brewy. She did have JVD bilaterally. She had a regular heart rate. She did have an S4 murmur when I was listening on the mitral valve, and her PMI was normal. Bilaterally, she did have wheezing and rails upon auscultation of her lungs. For the extremities, her calves were non-tender. She did have pedal edema in both feet, plus one, as well as her pulses were equal and normal. No Hoffman's sign. For her imaging, upon... Excuse me. Looking at her chest x-ray, she had mediastinal fullness and pulmonary edema in a normal-sized heart. And looking at her echo, they said that the diagnosis was restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness, ejection fraction 55%. Looking at her EKG, it was normal sinus rhythm, but she did have some non-sustained VTAC. Her labs were normal for troponin and elevated for BMP at 4,000. So, give me a little bit of time. Given all the information of her history, physical exam, and the imaging and labs, I diagnosed her with sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy. She had a New York Heart Association functional classification of three. And I told her we were going to admit her to telemetry for her serious condition, and we're going to check her vitals every two hours, and she can get out of bed with assistance. Strict IO. Daily weight will be monitored. DVT prophylaxis. She's going to be on a low sodium diet and IV fluids, KBO. No pain medication. We were going to start on amiodarone to help with her non-sustained VTAC. Helicinopril is fine to keep taking for high blood pressure. And then her prognosome we're going to increase to help with sarcoidosis in her heart and lungs. We also are going to add furosemide to help with the edema she's experiencing. And then we're going to consult interventional cardiologists, talk about an ACDI placement, and a radiologist to do a FDG PET scan to look at her heart better. And that's it."
" and I'm presenting to you today the case that I saw in the emergency room. I saw a 62-year-old female. She came in with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She reports that the onset of this occurred around two weeks ago, which she reported to her family medicine practice. They advised that she come in to be examined. She did report that she is experiencing dyspnea and paroxysmal orthopnea, which her dyspnea is worsened by strenuous activity or being active, whereas her orthopnea is worsened by laying down. Rest relieves her dyspnea and her orthopnea is relieved where she has to prop herself up on pillows, especially when she's sleeping. She also reports that during exertion, she does feel presyncopal episodes coming on, as well as she is significant for palpitations. The patient was alert and coherent. However, she was fatigued and pretty concerned about her current condition. Our review of systems yielded. She was negative for chest pain. She, again, was positive for palpitations and syncope. She denied wheezing or coughing, just dyspnea and orthopnea was positive. She did report that she did experience edema, and pitting edema specifically, and her past medical history is, again, significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams for, and she is also significant for hypertension, which she takes 10 milligrams of lisinopril for. She does report that she is consistent with her medication, and she uses it as prescribed. Her mother is also, her family has re-yielded that her mother did die suddenly of an unexplained cause at 40 years old, and then her father did die at 40 years old. Her mother died at 40 years old, and then her father did die at 40 years old. She is 59 years old from a ischemic cardiac event. She does report that she has no non-drug allergies. Upon physical exam, it yielded that she was tachycardic. She had a heart rate of 110. Her O2, or her pulse ox was 91%. Her respiration was 20 beats per minute. She was mildly hypertensive. She was 130 over 90. And, you know, continue with the physical exam, she, pulses were intact bilateral. There was no, there were no Burini's present. And auscultation did yield a cardiac murmur, and there was bilateral rails, as well as pitting edema present. Chest x-ray did, you know, reviewing the chest x-ray, it did reveal pulmonary edema, as well as mediastinal fullness and pulmonary infiltrates, which were detected, which were positive. for a Pollenberger sign. Her echocardiogram did yield that there was a thickening and there was a preserved ejection fraction of the heart. And her EKG did demonstrate that there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. So regarding her labs, her BMP was also significantly elevated to 4,000. And this was discussed with the patient as far as clinical findings are concerned. So given this information, I would say she also reports that she is a non-smoker, non-drinker. She's fairly active, which is how she noticed that something was going on. So regarding this information, I do believe that she is suffering from sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. And I would classify her as a New York Heart Association class three. She has a secondary diagnosis of hypertension as well as pulmonary edema. And my plan for this patient is to admit to telemetry. I want to consult with interventional cardiology as well as radiology. So we can go ahead and see if there may be a need for a pacemaker or we could also get a fed pet. A dish and a... Additionally, as far as orders are concerned, she can be activity as monitored activity or support. She's going to be on nasal cannula. And I like to start DVT prophylaxis as well as strict IO and daily weights. Additionally, I would like to continue her with Cineprol. However, I would like to increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams. And then I would also like to start her on amiodarone 150 so it can improve her cardiac output. And also for SVT. And as far as lifestyle modifications are concerned, as long as she maintains healthy weight, diet and weight reduction, she may be able to... When she meets with interventional cardiology and nuclear medicine, she may be able to have a better or an improved outcome. Thank you so much. And I look... forward to discussing this case with you. Bye."
" Okay. Good afternoon. So we have a 60-year-old woman who's presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient has experienced flu-like symptoms days prior to arrival. She states that her breathing is labored and sleeps in her recliner to alleviate the symptoms of shortness of breath. Her activity level has drastically decreased and her symptoms improve upon rest. She had a fever, cough, and runny nose, which has since subsided days prior. Patient also has chest pain, slight palpitations, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patient denies syncope and abnormal skin rashes or lesions. On further review of symptoms, patient does complain of wheezing and swelling in her lower legs. The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension in which she's currently taking lisinopril 10 milligrams by mouth. And the patient denies consuming alcohol, using illicit drugs, and smoking any tobacco products. Her vital signs that were within normal limits included the blood pressure, which was 130 over 90, and her temperature, which was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Her elevated vital signs included the heart rate, which was 110, and respiratory rate, which was 20. Her oxygen saturation level was decreased. It read 91.5. Her blood pressure was decreased by 90.5. Her oxygen concentration was reduced by 90.5. Her blood pressure was reduced by 90.5. Her blood pressure was reduced by 90.5. Her blood pressure was reduced by 90.5. And on physical exam, pinning edema was shown in her lower extremities. And also, rails and wheezing were noted during lung auscultation. Hypertension, actually, primary assessment is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to previous viral infection. However, hypertension could be provided as a secondary assessment. And the plan to treat these symptoms would be to admit the patient, to telemetry units, just for monitoring. And we also want to begin nursing to have her on a strict IO, to do daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and to place the patient on the O2 nasal cannula to increase the oxygen saturation to 96%. And also, we want to give her medications with lisinopril, acetaminophen, and furosemide. We want to do 10 milligrams by mouth of lisinopril, 625 milligrams by mouth every six hours of acetaminophen, and 40 milligrams of furosemide IV. And because she's on furosemide, we want to make sure we order a CMP. Because her troponin levels were also high, and her BMP was also high, we want to make sure we order troponin levels to be monitored and to do a repeat echocardiogram. That's her chest x-ray, and her echo showed, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. And the, echo showed, the left ventricular ejection fraction weight was below 30%. And we also want to have interventional cardiology follow her, as well as infectious disease and radiology. She's going to get a, um, contrast enhanced MRI of her heart as well as be put on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids because of the infection. And we would like to, um, look at a endomyocardial biopsy, as well as CRTD and AICD, which are just the pacemaker and defibrillation. And we will have the patient continue to be monitored and checked every two hours while on the floor. Thank you."
" Leslie Walker, he's a 62-year-old male that presents with shortness of breath and fatigue. He is a current smoker, and he currently has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. I did a physical exam on him, and he shows wheezing and biobasilar rawls, as well as jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema. He also stated that he is having trouble laying down, breathing, so I believe he's got some orthopnea, some dyspnea going on as well. And he states that. He's got some orthopnea, some dyspnea going on, breathing, so I believe he's got some orthopnea, some dyspnea going on. And he states that. I looked at his X-ray. His X-ray showed some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. And then I looked at his lab results and saw that his BMP is severely elevated, showing some fluid buildup in the heart, as well as an elevated troponin, which shows some damage to the heart that's going on. I believe what's going on is ischemic heart disease. I think that. Next best step in his treatment should be to admit him to the ICU. I believe that we should have him follow up with the cardiologist for a possible AICD placement and or CRTD placement. I would like to start keep him on his clopidogrel and warfarin and adenobunamine as an ionotrope to help his heart beat a little better. And. We can go in together and see him now. All right. Thank you. Thank you."
" I'm here today reporting about a 62-year-old patient who came in complaining about shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. That started about three days ago, and it has been a constant level of discomfort since then. Patient mentioned she had a clue-like symptoms about two weeks ago, but recovered fully. Patient states the discomfort level is mainly in the chest area, and she is unable to sleep in bed, so she has been sleeping in recliner. Patient also states she has shortness of breath at rest. Patient, as well as patient, states the severity of discomfort as 2 out of 10. Patient has past medical history of hypertension and currently taking lisinofril to manage that, and has no known drug allergy, as well as no past surgical history. Patient mom passed away of breast cancer, and father is diagnosed with Alzheimer's and currently in nursing facility. Patient is an elementary school teacher and currently lives with her husband. Upon conducting review of system, patient mentioned to have fatigue, weight gain, about 8 pounds, lower extremity swelling, chest pain, palpitation, wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patient vitals were slightly elevated to a stage 1 hypertension and was tachycardic. Upon conducting full physical exam, I found patient to have JVD. Patient had JVD distension, chartite bruise, but no murmur, friction, rub, or gallop. Patient also had wheezing and bilateral grills present upon ausculting her lungs. Patient had pedal edema as well, but no chest wall tenderness. X-ray results showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricle ejection fraction of 30%. EKG results showed sinus. I had a right ventricle branch block. Patient lab test also showed elevated troponin and BNP. Based on all these available tests and clinical examination, our determined patient had myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and admitted her to telemetry. Based on patient information, I also assigned her class 4 heart failure. I'm also adding 625 mg acetaminophen and 40 mg IV flora. I'm also adding 2 mg flurosomide to her medications along with continuation of 10 mg lisinophril. I'm also ordering serial troponin and CMP lab tests as well as repeat of 2D echo. I'm setting her up to have consultation with interventional cardiology to discuss about potentially placing any device placement as well as doing an endomyocardial biopsy. I'm also setting her up with infectious disease to go over about the immunoglobulin or glucoforticoid to better manage her condition right now. And radiology for MRI. I shared all of this information with the care team and discussed about necessity to recheck all her initial vitals as well as checked vitals every 2 hours. I'm also advised low sodium diet for now. That's all I have for now. Thank you very much."
" Leslie Parker is a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department complaining of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue. She reports a recent illness about two weeks ago with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her fever and cough resolved about five days ago, but she's still experiencing dyspnea, worsened with exertion, and lying flat. She has a past medical history of hypertension, which is treated with lisinopril 10 milligrams. She has no known drug allergies. In terms of her past family history, her mother passed from breast cancer, and her father has Alzheimer's dementia. She eats a balanced diet, does not drink alcohol, and does not use tobacco. She exercises regularly and has moderate caffeine intake. In addition to her fatigue and dyspnea, she reports recent waist gain, muscle soreness, lower extremity swelling, a dull, constant chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, and wheezing. Upon physical exam, I noted jugular venous distension, but no carotid bruise. Her heart auscultation did not reveal any murmurs or gallops. Her PMI was laterally diagnosed. Her chest was displaced, but she had no chest wall tenderness. Her lung auscultation revealed bi-basilar rails and wheezing. Upon evaluation of her lower extremities, she had 1-plus pitting edema. However, her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were full and equal, and her calves were non-tender. Her labs and imaging revealed increased troponin and a BMP of 4,000. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and her echo showed a dilated left ventricle with decreased ejection fraction. Her EKG showed tachycardia with a right bundle branch block. Based on these findings and her clinical history and my physical exam, this patient most likely has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I would recommend admitting to telemetry. Activity is tolerated with a low-sodium diet. She should continue her lisinopril. We should add furosemide 40 mg IV and acetaminophen 625 mg for pain. We should consult with a doctor. We should consult with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD and biopsy for definitive diagnosis. We should also consult with infectious disease for possible use of immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids. And we should consult with radiology for enhanced cardiac MRI to better view the inflammation in her heart."
" a 62-year-old male patient presented with shortness of breath and fatigue. He stated that the symptoms started around six months ago and have progressively worsened. He noted that he went to his PCP three days ago and felt the need to come to the ER due to his extensive cardiovascular history. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, all of which have been treated with prescription medications thus far. He has had an open heart surgery, he said, around 12 years ago, a CABG and a stent each. So he's had, I'm sorry, he's had one stent for the past five years. And he also noted that he has been told that he has lacked access deviation and less than 40% ejection fracture on, fraction on ultrasound that he obtained last year. Regarding his family, his mother passed away at the age of 80 years old from breast cancer. His father is 82 years old and has Alzheimer's, currently living in a nursing home. So the patient, a little about him personally, he does not drink alcohol. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for the past 30 years and notes that he is not ready to quit when asked. And he does not use illicit drugs. He does not have a history of it either. He states that he eats a balanced diet, drinks one cup of coffee a day, and he used to walk with friends several times a week, but he has not been able to recently due to his shortness of breath. He is a fifth grade teacher and is married and lives with significant others. Other notes that he has a great support system. He also states that he stated that he does not have any allergies and takes several medications daily of which are, I'm sorry for my pronunciation. So once again, he complains of, complains of, of fatigue, even at rest now, an eight pound weight gain over the past two weeks, pleasing in terms of breath. He notes that he does not have any skin changes. No, he changes chest pain, palpitations, syncope, AS, MSK, or neuro complications either. So that said on exam, he was awake, oriented and fatigued. He does not have a fever, did not have a fever. He had a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. His blood sugar was low. He was on a diet, but he was on a diet. He was on a diet, but he was on a diet. His blood pressure was 80 over 50 and his oxygen was at 86%. He had a positive JVD, no bruise. He had wheezing and rails on lung auscultation, pedal edema, but no tenderness. And importantly, he had a displaced PMI laterally. X-rays showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Ultrasound showed decreased ejection fraction. And the EKG showed no postoperative changes. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, LVH, voltage criteria in a left bundle branch block. Labs had elevated troponin and a BMP of 4,000. Overall, I assess that he was a New York Heart Association class IV. Together, the patient and I discussed that he had ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and it's essentially just progression of his previous heart condition. And we decided that we will admit him to the ICU due to his serious condition and check his vitals every two hours. He will be on bed rest and the nurse will be notified or has been notified that he will have strict IO, take daily weights, and maintain DBT prophylaxis. He will have a low sodium diet, KBO, IV fluids, and we discontinued all his medications, except the lipotigrel and the warfarin. We started him on dubitamine, IV drip, and an insulin sliding scale for his diabetes. We also started him on BiPAP. And we will check his INT and serial troponins frequently. I'm sorry, not INT, what I'm talking about. INR, because he's taking warfarin. Overall, we referred him to an original cardiologist for IACD or CRT placement. That's it. Thank you."
" Today I'm presenting on Ms. Palmer, who is a 62-year-old female who presented to the ED with complaints of some chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Ms. Palmer said that she saw her family physician a few days ago with similar symptoms unresolved and if symptoms worsened to go to the ED. Ms. Palmer said a few weeks ago she had flu-like symptoms with fever, cough, runny nose, and shortness of breath and fatigue. Most of those symptoms went away a few days ago, other than the shortness of breath and fatigue. Ms. Palmer said that she uses pillows to sleep, so she's elevated, and she has tried no treatments, and the only alleviating factor for her shortness of breath is sleep. She continued to go into the gym after her flu-like symptoms, but eventually had to stop due to her symptoms worsening. She said that her symptoms get a lot worse with exercise and moderate activity, but day-to-day activities are mainly unaffected. The patient presented with an increased heart rate at 110 and a decreased oxygen saturation. The patient presented with an increased heart rate at 110 and a decreased oxygen saturation. The surgical history includes a cardiac catheterization procedure about a year ago. The patient told me that there's no medical history, though they are on lisinopril, which leads me to believe that the patient does have hypertension. The patient has a balanced diet and does moderate exercise weekly, about two to three times a week. The mother has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old, and the father has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old. The mother has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old, and the father has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old, and is currently in a nursing home. Review of systems included a well-developed, well-nourished patient who is fatigued and in pain, and has gained eight pounds since two weeks ago. This may be due to her lower extremity edema and swelling, and myalgia, which was shown on the physical exam. The patient had a complete recovery. The patient complained of heart fluttering and had heart palpitations and a laterally displaced PMI. The patient complained of wheezing and coughing and dyspnea and orthopnea, with orthopnea being worse. The physical ulcers showed JVD with no carotid bruise. The AP friendly showed opposites to BPN, WS, D19, and HCT. She's severely inflamed. It might be blemished to the neck, or peel loved limbs. She isright joining the nutrition section at a 90–foot stretch, and was collar<|de|> R-to–N–M variation, should concrete that. The pediatric physician görei showed that in a 90—foot stretch, the patient was extremely jealousy- Multiparty treatment measures included diuretic heart inflammation in reconstruction and she was completely bluff with stabbed fuck when not through damage. um so based on this information i believe that the state the patient had myocarditis that caused dilated cardiomyopathy due to viral cause um the new york heart association stage is a stage two with heart failure with reduced rejection reduced ejection fraction of 30 percent my plan is to admit this patient to the telemetry unit and um keep their lisinopril add acetaminophen and frosamide at 40 milligrams iv acetaminophen at 625 milligrams uh orally uh we're going to consult interventional cardiology for a defibrillator and aicd placement and also do a right ventricular biopsy we want to consult infectious disease for immune globulin or glucocorticoid treatment and get a radiologist contrast media enhanced mri um we want to do strict ios daily weights dbt prophylaxis o2 um vianesa cannula to get the oxygen back up to above 96 percent other than that we want to do a serial troponin again and repeat the echo and also get cmp um the patient had no questions upon the consult upon my uh consultation and advising them after their treatment plan and physical findings ii our you uh ceremony from as a man which at halfway point in their movement that check product gd artist should be Gosh, dont say we cant see it!"
" On the patient I just saw in the ED, I saw a 60-year-old female who presented to the emergency room today with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue. The onset of the shortness of breath and fatigue began over the last six months and has been gradually worsening. The patient states that she is even short of breath at rest and symptoms are worsening with any and all physical activity. The patient states that she has been sleeping in a chair in her recliner at night and is unable to walk with her friends anymore due to her symptoms. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her social history includes that she is a one-pack-per-day smoker for the past 30 years. Her medications include lisinopril, 10 milligrams, metropole, suscine, 50 milligrams. Retorvastatin, 10 milligrams. Metformin, 500 milligrams. Furosemide, 20 milligrams. Coplitagrel, 75 milligrams. Warfarin, 2.5 milligrams. She has no known drug allergies. Mother died of breast cancer and father currently has Alzheimer's and is living in a nursing facility. Patient's surgical history includes a cabbage and stents. Through the review of systems and the physical exam findings, patient was fatigued and recently gained weight, 8 pounds within the last two weeks. Skin testing was negative. HEE and T was positive for JVD. Her cardio revealed tachycardia with a split S2, a displaced PMI but no murmurs, gallops, or frictional rubs. Pulmonary testing revealed bilateral rails, orthopnea, dyspnea, and a split S2. She has no known drug allergies. She has no known drug allergies. Her heart rate was 90, a low blood pressure of 80 over 50, and an SPO2 level of 86, very low. Her troponin level came back slightly elevated at 0.4. Her BNP was also elevated. Her blood pressure was at 4,000. So the diagnosis for this patient is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, which would be due to her medical history, particularly her hyperlipidemia and her smoking history contributing. Plan is to admit to the ICU. And diagnosis includes an NYHA functional classification of level 4. Condition is serious. Allergies, no known. Vitals Q2 hours activity strict bedrests. Nursing instructions include strict. Intravenous daily weights, DVT prophylaxis. Her diet is restricted to low sodium. IV fluids are KVO. Keep being open medications where you're holding all existing medications, except for clopidogrel 75 milligrams. Her warfarin 2.5. We will be adding a dopamine IV drip and replacing. Her metformin with an insulin sliding scale. Respiratory therapy includes bipap and for labs and imaging. I'm doing serial troponin levels and a PT INR for her warfarin. The specialists I'd like to consult are the interventional cardiologists for a either a CRTD or AICD placement. And that is everything for the six year old patient who came into the ED today. And presented with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Thank you very much. Thank you."
" is 62-year-old Mr. Leslie Palmer. He presents with a six-month history of shortness of breath and fatigue. He has symptoms even at rest and has recently been sleeping in his armchair at night due to orthopnea. Symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and fatigue increase with any kind of activity and return to baseline at rest. He has also noticed an eight-pound weight gain in the past two weeks and has noticed swelling in his lower extremities. In terms of medical history, he has a long-standing history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, for which he is taking ortorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, succinate, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. In terms of surgical interventions, he has had open heart surgery with a three-vessel coronary artery by Kapas Graf 12 years ago and has had five stents, with the most recent one being a year ago in the left anterior descender. He is not amenable to further surgical intervention. His mother passed due to breast cancer and his father is currently in a medical facility for Alzheimer's disease. In terms of social history, Mr. Palmer does not partake in illicit drugs or alcohol. He does have one cup of coffee each morning with breakfast and does have a one-day medical history of Alzheimer's disease. He has a long-standing history of tobacco use. He works as an elementary school teacher and claims to have a balanced diet. He also walks regularly, though recently he has found this difficult due to his symptoms. Upon physical examination, Mr. Palmer was found to have jugular venous distension, tachycardia with a split S2, and laterally displaced PMI, and was positive for a gallop. Tulsa, in addition to the COPD, has beenMichael Um, they suggested, I suggested an ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Um, all of patients medications were terminated except for clopidogrel and warfarin. Uh, we started him on dobutamine and admitted him to the ICU where he will be put on an insulin sliding scale and will be on a BiPAP machine. He was referred to interventional, interventional cardiology for AICD placement and CRTD placement. Um, he was also consulted about social supports and financial supports before being dismissed. Thank you so much."
" Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, and orthopnea following a cold that began two weeks ago. The patient states she is unable to exercise due to the dyspnea, which occurs with slight activity. Patient takes 10 milligrams of lisinopril QD for hypertension and states she had a routine cardiac cath one year ago. No known drug allergies, alcohol, or drug use were reported. Patient admits to an eight-pound weight gain over the past two weeks with heart palpitations. Heart rate was 110, O2 was 91, respiratory rate was 20, pulse was 110, BP was 130 over 90, and temp was normal. Physical exam findings were positive for JVD, a laterally displaced PMI, bivasilar rails, wheezing, and a one-plus pitting edema in lower extremities. Posterior tibial pulses were full and equal. Troponin and BMP levels were elevated. An EKG showed a right bundle branch block. With sinus tachycardia. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. And an echo showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%. Patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and will be admitted to telemetry. Patient will be placed on nasal cannula with two liters per minute of oxygen flow with oxygen stats being maintained above 96%. Patient will continue taking her lisinopril as prescribed. Be given 625 milligrams. of acetaminophen, PO, Q6 hours for chest pain. And IV furosemide, 40 milligrams, Q12 hours for edema. Interventional cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology were consulted."
" report on a patient I saw in a clinic today. Mr. Leslie Palmer presented today with complaints of some shortness of breath, some fluttering, wheezing, near syncope upon walking with friends for approximately 45 minutes. Patient states that it's been happening now for a couple of weeks. They do not have any pain or any coughing though. The symptoms are alleviated with rest. It's really just the walking extensive amounts of time or any larger exertions cause that near syncope. Patient said that they are able to do everyday activities around the house without any symptoms, but they said when they do have those symptoms, they would rate it a 10, that it was absolutely terrible. They felt like they would absolutely pass out without rest. So looking a little bit more into the patient's history, their mother had a sudden death at the age of 40. Their father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 69. The patient himself did present with hypertension and he was taking lisinopril for that, 10 milligrams, but he also does not have any allergies to any drugs. Patient said that they had a lot of pain and they felt like they would absolutely pass out without rest. They haven't been hospitalized for anything, but they did have a heart cath approximately a year ago. It was an outpatient procedure and all the results came back normal. No other surgeries other than that. Patient said that they do have a balanced diet. They exercise pretty regularly, but obviously they've been limited now with the one coming of symptoms. With exercise, they report, and that was three to four times a week typically before symptoms caught on. No drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, normal caffeine intake, about a cup of coffee a day. They are employed as a seventh grade math teacher and they are married to a man, monogamous relationship of 22 years. Patient reports no general findings, no skin findings for review of systems, no muscle. Surgery is going to be a little bit different. It's going to be a little bit more common. No brain damage, no musculoskeletal, no HE and T, no neuro findings. Patient does, as I said before, complain of a flutter near syncope, but without any chest pain. Patient does have shortness of breath and wheezing. The shortness of breath is when they're standing upon exertion. It's not specifically when they lie down. Presenting today, they were slightly tachycardic with a heart rate of 110, which I discussed with them as being possible that it's a pathology, but also with that, they're not going to be able to perform as they normally would. So they're not going to be with the idea of white coat syndrome, it could have easily been just because of their current presentation. Their oxygen saturation was 96%, and their blood pressure upon presentation was 130 over 90, with a normal temperature of 98.6 and normal respirations of 16. With the patient's presentation and physical exam, with physical exam findings, I did find that they had pitting edema, um, minor pitting edema of the lower extremity. Um, I did, uh, hear the bilateral rails. I, I heard the wheezing. Um, I heard, uh, upon examination of the aorta and the, uh, PMI, I didn't find any aortic aneurysm, but I did, uh, find a displaced PMI laterally, bilaterally. Um, and upon my osteopathic screening was negative, and upon my physical exam as a whole, uh, I did. I did come to the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis for Mr. Palmer, uh, was familial, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Um, I did inform him that, that, uh, that could be a cause of his, uh, mother's unfortunate passing, uh, and it is something that's inherited typically. I, I admitted Mr. Palmer, uh, to telemetry, uh, so he can have constant heart monitoring, and, um, I, uh, I'm switching his medication. I did not note it on the, uh, on the form, but I, I have notified the nurse that I'm switching the medication from lisinopril to dosapiramide. Um, and I am going to have his vitals checked every two hours. We're going to refer him to the cardiologist for, uh, for, uh, uh, pacemaker placement, and as well as to the cardiothoracic surgeon for a possible myomectomy or, uh, alcohol injection to, uh, uh, to help with that septal hypertrophy. I reviewed his results. Uh, he understood the EKG findings, uh, of left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as, um, the x-ray finding of cardiomegaly, as well as the echo. Um, so, uh, Mr. Leslie was alert. He was well, uh, and oriented, and, uh, he had no further questions regarding my workup. Um, and yeah, I, I told him that, uh, he would follow up with you, and, uh, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out. Uh, he's a pleasant dude, and hopefully, uh, he gets up and at him, uh, sooner rather than later. Thanks."
" I mean, Mr. Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old male who presents to the ER with dyspnea and orthopenia and fatigue. He believes it's been going on for six months and it's gotten progressively worse. He went to this family physician. Last week, they had run some labs, but they have not given him any updates on that. So he came in today because he felt more worse. He does not, he used to work out, but he's not alleviated by rest now. So he's been lessening his working out and he is a NYHA class four candidate because of the rest. And he only can sleep in his chair, but laying down flat makes it worse. His vitals were 98.6 temperature. His heart rate was 90. His blood pressure was 80 over 50. His respiratory rate was 22 and his O2 stat was 86. His social history is good, but he's still a pack-a-day smoker and a moderate caffeine user with one complication. He's still a smoker, but he's still a smoker. up a day and he lives with his wife for 30 years. He feels well supported and happy with her. He also is a school teacher for eighth grade and he feels that he likes his job. His medical history that's pertinent is that he has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. His diabetes he feels is well regulated by his medication. He is on lisinopril 10 milligrams, atruvastatin 10 milligrams, clopidogrel 75 milligrams, metformin 500 milligrams a day, thurosamide 20 milligrams a day, metroprol succinate 50 milligrams a day, and warfarin 2.5 milligrams a day. He has had a history of a cabbage and five stints over the past five years. His cardiologist says that he does not want to do any more since his last stint was June 2022. His father's history is Alzheimer's who is still with us and in a nursing home right now. His mother died from breast cancer five years ago and his physical exam showed a positive for JVD. Plus one pitting edema in his lower extremity and his pulses were equal. His DP and PT pulses were equal. He has bilateral rails and wheezing present on his evaluation. No murmur or rub. Plus G tachycardia split S1. EKG showed a left bundle branch block with LVH criteria, normal sinus rhythm. His troponin levels were 0.04 elevated. BMP was 4,000. It was elevated and his trach sexoration was 0.0. He has a lot of blood pressure. He has a lot of blood pressure. His cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo showed dilated left ventricular with 30% ejection fraction. We all agreed. I believe I should admit him to the ICU. So that is what we did. We're going to have to bring in an interventional cardiologist who can do an AICD and a CRTD. We are going to put him on dobutamine and take off his other medications. He can stay on clopidogrel and warfarin. He can take off his other medications. He can stay on clopidogrel and warfarin. We would like to stop every other medication and put him on insulin sliding scale, give him BiPAP for that 8602, put him on a low sodium diet, strict bed rest, and monitor his serial troponins. Thank you."
" presenting with the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. He was alert, awake, and oriented, but obviously fatigued. He stated that these symptoms have become progressively worse over the last six months. Mr. Palmer states that all activity exacerbates his shortness of breath and fatigue, and he does confirm that he's still having symptoms at rest. He states that lying flat worsens his condition, nothing improves it, and that he has been sleeping in his chair at night. His respiratory rate was high at 22, his blood pressure was low at 80 over 50, and his oxygen saturation was low at 86%. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, for which he takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, warfarin 2.5 milligrams twice a day, clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day, metformin 500 milligrams twice a day, atorvastatin 10 milligrams once a day, furosemide 20 milligrams twice a day, and metoprolsuccinate 50 milligrams once a day. The patient also reported a triple bypass previously. And that he's had five stents, with the last being in June 2022, for a left anterior descending occlusion. The patient said that at that time, his physician told him he was not going to be a candidate for any more procedures, and he's had no other hospitalizations besides for those cardiac procedures. He has a maternal family history of terminal breast cancer and a paternal family history of Alzheimer's. The patient did endorse fatigue and eight-pound weight gain over two weeks, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and a heart attack. The patient also reported a triple bypass of the left anterior anterior occlusion, and he is currently in the state of postpartum atrial fibrillation. His physical exam showed JVD without carotid bruit, tachycardia with a split S2, laterally displaced PMI, basilar rails and wheezing on auscultation of his lungs. He had a plus one pitting edema, with intact distal pulses and non-tender calves in his lower extremities. His labs showed a troponin of 0.04 and a BNP of 4,000, both of which are high. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His 2D echo showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30%, and his EKG showed a left axis displacement with a left bundle branch block. I diagnosed him today with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to his previous cardiac history, his physical exam, and the labs I got back today, as well as that imaging. He is a New York Heart Association stage four and should be admitted to the ICU. His condition is serious. He has no known drug allergies. I'd like him to have a daily daily dose of 2-3 pills every two hours, strict bed rest, strict input output, daily weights, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. I'd like him on a low sodium diet. I'd like him on an IV fluid protocol of fluid lock, keep vein open. I'm going to hold all meds except his clopidogrel, 75 milligrams once a day, and his warfarin, 2.5 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to add a dobutamine IV drip and an insulin sliding scale. The patient should be on BiPAP with an input of 16 and an output of six. I would like him to have serial troponins to monitor his troponin levels since it was high earlier. And I'd like him to continue having PTINRs to monitor his clotting as we have him on both clopidogrel and warfarin. I will be consulting interventional cardiology to discuss the possible placement of a CRTD or an AICD. And then after discharge, the patient will be instructed to maintain a healthy diet, weight, and then avoid strenuous activity until he is released by the hospital.

" Mr. Palmer is a 62 year old male who presented at the clinic today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. His vitals show a blood pressure of 80 over 50, a heart rate of 90, SpO2 of 86, pulse of 90, and temperature of 98.6. Mr. Palmer stated that these symptoms have been going on for the past six months and have worsened progressively. He visited his primary care physician a few days ago and symptoms have exponentially worsened since. He states he is unable to perform any physical activities as he experiences extreme shortness of breath but is okay at rest. He says he cannot breathe when laying down to sleep and therefore has to sleep upright. Patient denies any pain and no medications were taken to help with the symptoms. Patient has not experienced anything like this before and rates his discomfort at a 10 out of 10. Review of symptoms showed fatigue, weight gain, wheezing, orthopnea, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. Mr. Palmer's other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation for which he takes metoprolol, 50 mg once a day, lisinopril, 10 mg once a day, atorvastatin, 10 mg once a day, metformin, 500 mg twice a day, furosemide, 20 mg twice a day, clopidogrel, 75 mg once a day, and warfarin, 2.5 mg twice a day. He has a history of a tertiary bypass performed 12 years ago and five stents placed, one of which was a left anterior descending stent placed in June of 2022. Patient has no pertinent symptoms. He is unable to perform any physical activities. Patient's social history includes a balanced diet with moderate caffeine intake, no alcohol or illicit drug consumption. Patient not only smokes one pack per day for the past 30 years and appropriate counseling was provided. Patient is married and has a stable occupation. Pertinent physical exam findings include positive jugular venous distension with no bruise, heart auscultation revealed, detect cardio with a split S2, and no murmurs. Palpation revealed a laterally displaced patient. Laterally displaced PMI and no chest wall tenderness. Lung loss quotations revealed by basal reveals and wheezing with plus one pitting edema noted with full pulses and negative Hellman sign or calf tenderness. OMIM examination revealed no TAR changes or tenderness upon palpation of Chapman's points. Labs include elevated troponin at 0.4 and elevated BNP at 4,000. X-rays show cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echo revealed dilated chambers with an ejection fraction of less than 30%. An EKG is shown to be a positive. The patient is not in a state of shock. The patient is on the verge of terminal paralysis. The patient's EKG is revealed normal sinus rhythm meeting left ventricle hypertrophy voltage criteria and left bundle branch block. A likely diagnosis in this case is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mr. Palmer was counseled on his smoking habits and advised that this may worsen the problem. The patient was also advised that this condition is likely due to his past cardiac medical history. The patient was admitted to telemetry and has a NYHA-based surgery. In the experience of the patient, the patient was admitted to telemetry and has a NYHA-based surgery. Four, classification. All current medications will be withheld except quopitogrel and warfarin, endobutamine, and an insulin signing scale will be started. Patient was put on BiPAP to assist with oxygenation. A PT, INR, and serial troponin will be reordered and monitored. Patient is on strict bed rest with IO, daily weights, monitoring, DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, and KVO. Vitals will be checked, Q2H. Interventional cardiology was consulted, and a patient will be taken for AICD and CRTD placement. Thank you."
" A 65-year-old female, Ms. Palmer, reports to the emergency department today with complaints of shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue. Her onset has been worsening for the past two months, but it's gotten especially bad in the past three days since visiting with her primary care physician on Friday. She was advised to go to the emergency department because of her symptoms. She's comfortable at rest, awake, alert, and oriented, and also reports multiple episodes of near syncope within the past two months. She has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Her past surgical history includes a heart catheter that she said that it was normal. Her mom passed away at 40 years old, sudden death, and her father passed away at 59 years old for myocardial infarction. She has a well-balanced diet. She enjoys going on walks. No illicit drug use, no tobacco, no alcohol. She's currently in LSD. She's a elementary school teacher. She reports having one cup of coffee per day before work so she can get through. And she's been married for the past 30 years, has one sexual partner. So her current medications include lisinopril and prednisone for the sarcoidosis and lisinopril for the hypertension. She has no known drug allergies. She reported fatigue. So the only pertinent positives for her review of systems were fatigue, palpitations, wheezing. and lower extremity swelling, especially around her ankles. Her physical findings were positive for JVD, negative for bruise, positive for palpitations. And there was a murmur present, an early systolic murmur. She reported wheezing and by basilar rails on auscultation. She... Lower extremity edema was found on physical exam as well. Of her labs, all were negative besides her BNP, which was elevated to 4,000. And her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, and a normal cardiac silhouette. Her echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with non-sustained left ventricular tachycardia. Her joyoblast is safe by no means What I saw afterwards after talking to the patient. Naeer Cult assays, association class two, because she did not report having difficulty with activities besides exercise.

It's a serious condition. She will be getting vitals due two hours and out of bed with assistance. And nursing instructions include strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and O2 via nasal cannula to make sure that it's at least 96%. I recommended a low-sodium diet so that we can get some of the fluid off. We included keeping the vein open for fluids. We will continue the lisinopril, but we will also add on furosemide, 40 milligrams IV, and increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams. And we'll be administering amiodarone, 150 milligrams via IV, because of the ventricular tachycardia. And we will also be ordering a CMP panel for labs, and so we can further monitor the sarcoidosis. And we'll be consulting interventional cardiology for defibrillator AICD placement, and we'll be consulting radiology to get a PET scan to further show the sarcoidosis."
" This is Palmer, who is a 62-year-old female with a history of pulmonary sarcoid and hypertension. She comes to the ED today with episodes of shortness of breath, near syncope, as well as fatigue and palpitations and orthopnea. She says that this has been going on for about two months and worsening since onset. She saw her primary care physician for her symptoms about three days ago and had some tests done. She's unsure of what tests were done, and she hasn't gotten those results back yet. She called them today due to exacerbation of her symptoms and was referred to the ER. She says that her symptoms are exacerbated with most of her activity. She notes that she... Was previously very active, walking about five times a week, but now is unable to do that due to her symptoms. She also notes orthopnea, noting that she is now sleeping in the recliner due to shortness of breath when lying flat. She denies any loss of consciousness. She denies chest pain. She does endorse an eight-pound weight gain in the past two weeks, as well as some... Lower extremity swelling. She also endorses some subjective wheezing. Her history, as I said, she has pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she is on chronic prednisone, 10 milligrams. She also has hypertension, for which she's on lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day. She had a clean cardiac cath about a year ago after an abnormal EKG or PCP. She denies... She has tobacco use, alcohol, illicit drug use. She lives at home with her husband, who she says is supportive. She does have insurance for her job as a fourth grade teacher. Vitals were significant for slight tachycardia at 110, with slight hypertension at 136 over 99. Her SpO2 was slightly hypoxic at 91%. She was eight feb. brow. She had a lot of symptoms, and she was in a very good state. Physical exam was significant for a systolic murmur with an S4 gallop. She did have positive JVD, but no carotid bruise. She had bipasular rows and wheeze in her lungs, in both lungs. She did have one plus pedal edema with no capitularness and negative Hohmann's sign. Labs were remarkable for a... an elevated troponin of 4,000, or... or elevated BMP of 4,000, I'm sorry, and a negative troponin. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal fullness consistent with pulmonary sarcoid. She had no cardiomegaly and no pulmonary edema. EKG did show a sinus tachycardia at a rate of about 100. She had a normal access. She did have a run of non-sustained V-tach on the EKG. But her rhythm in the room was a normal sinus. ECHO did show restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness. EF was normal at 55%. I believe that her symptoms are due to sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with an NYHA scale of 3. For her, I would like to admit her to telemetry. And... give her imiodarone for the non-sustained V-tach. Keep her on her lisinopril and increase her prednisone dose to 60 milligrams a day PO. I also would like to give 40 milligrams of furosemide IV for her fluid overload. As far as labs, I would like to order a... CMP to keep an eye on her potassium because we're giving that furosemide. I don't believe she needs any diagnostic imaging orders at this time. But I do want to consult radiology for a possible FDG PET scan to look at the infiltrates in her heart. I would also like to consult interventional cardiology for a possible AICD placement, given the NSP. EL BR發 cared by While In outsiders Thank you very much!

" Mr. Leslie presented to the clinic today. He's a 62-year-old male. I'm going to restart. 62-year-old male, Mr. Leslie presented to the clinic today, three days after something concerning came up from his family medicine doctor. He has a fairly extensive past medical history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. He is a type 1 diabetic and smoked a pack a day for 30 years. But he, more concerning right now is his elevated blood work, his troponins, he has severe orthopnea and very, very extensive undue dyspnea on exertion. So even having dyspnea at rest, but he has a history of AFib. He's had an open heart surgery. He's had a CABG, he's had a CABG artery bypass graft. He's had a cardiac stent for the past, one a year for the last five years. His parents didn't necessarily have any sort of similar issues. He was, like I mentioned, he was a, he is a smoker. For his stance, he's on blood, he's on clopidogrel, metoprolol, he's on furosemide, lisinopril, warfarin, metformin. He doesn't have any allergies. He has, he's had eight pounds of edema in his lower extremities that he noted. He's had a lot of edema in his lower extremities that he noted. During the review of systems, there's very few pertinent negatives on our thing, except he has not experienced any chest pain or discomfort. No palpitations, though he says he has some sort of on and off AFib, paroxysmal AFib, atrial fibrillation. And walking in, notice his blood pressure to be 80 over 50, heart rate of 90, respiratory, respire is a little bit elevated, a bit, a bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. And very low of two SATs, SPO2 around 86%. Did have jugular venous extension on physical exam. No murmur, friction rub, gallop. His PMI was displaced bilaterally and then sure enough, he had a cardiomegaly on, on chest x-ray. Rail, sure enough, were present. Did in fact have pedal edema. Normal pulses and extremities. He does have an ejection fraction of less than 30% on, on 2D echo, P-lax view. BMP was elevated, troponin was elevated. Also classified here as a New York Heart Association, New York Heart Association class four heart failure. Likely now going the direction of adding dibutamine on top of the, the not working. Intervascular, very dry, nearly as a potato chip. And he, he cannot take any more diuretics. So we're going to add dibutamine. So I'd like to add dibutamine. Definitely going to admit him to the ICU as a critical patient. Monitor him every two hours. Strict eyes and nose, DVD prophylaxis. Have him take good care of him. Do a KVO. No standing fluids because he's in pretty bad severe heart failure. Isn't having any pain, but I'll keep a, I'll keep him in the ICU. So I'm going to add dibutamine. I would like to keep a thinner going, a thinner going. Do not, not adding any sort of diuretics. I put them on an insulin sliding scale instead of his metformin. Of course, monitoring PTINR. And then I'm going to have interventional cardiology, take a look at him, though. They had, they said no more stinting or cabbage bypasses, but, but it is likely that I would recommend maybe a, because of a left bundle branch block and a left axis on the axis on EKG, I recommend a cardio resynchronization therapy device, as well. As an automated internal cardiac defibrillator. If, if noted, if deemed so by the interventional cardiologist. That is all I have. We will keep an eye on him, watch him very closely. We'll send him up to the ICU now, if that is okay. All right. Studio detective Tate, out. ."
" She's a 62 year old female who presented to the emergency department due to extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. She did include that about two weeks ago she was sick with a fever, cough, runny nose, and she thought she just had a cold. She was able to continue to exercise through this time, but it was just causing some fatigue and shortness of breath. She said about five days ago her symptoms resolved and she thought she was getting better. But then she went to her primary care doctor three days ago because she was still having really bad fatigue when she was trying to do activities. The fatigue and shortness of breath does not occur at rest. I took a history of the patient. She does have a medical history of hypertension and surgical wise. She had a cardiac catheter done, but she said there were no significant findings with that. She does take one medication, which is lisinopril 10 milligrams. As far as family history, her mom passed away from breast cancer. About five years ago. And her dad is currently in a home. He has Alzheimer's or dementia, but he's still living. As far as her social history, she does not use any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She works as an elementary school teacher. She said her diet is good and balanced. Her caffeine use is moderate. She says about a cup a day. As far as exercise, she does remain active. She likes to go to the gym about three times a week, but has been unable to since her cardiac symptoms, shortness of breath, and fatigue started. She has been on a diet for about a year. And as far as living situation, she is married and stated she feels supported and comfortable at home. She has no known drug allergies. As far as her ROS, she did have fatigue and a recent weight gain. She stated of about eight pounds. There were no skin issues, no headache or neck stiffness. She did feel chest palpitations, and she was also positive for wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, meaning she was more out of breath while she was laying down. She also did notice some lower extremity edema. As far as her appearance, she was awake and oriented. She was just extremely fatigued. Her vital signs, her temperature was 98.6, so no fever. Blood pressure was 130 over 90. Oxygen was 91. Heart rate 110. And respiratory rate was 20. For physical exam, I didn't hear no carotid brewery was present, but she did have JVD. As far as her heart, she had a regular rate. No murmur, friction rub, or gallop were heard, but her PMI was displaced laterally. Wheezes and rails were also present, but she had no chest wall tenderness. She had no calf tenderness. Her lower extremity pulses were full and equal, and she did have plus one pitting edema. As far as her chest x-ray, this indicated cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary edema, which I explained to the patient. And her echo was indicative of a dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. Her EKG came back as sinus tachycardia with a right bundle. In her labs, her troponin was elevated, and her BNP level was 4,000. Now, knowing all of this, plus her history and her diagnostics, I did make the diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. She was at a NYHA classification of 2 because she was still able to do some activity, and her symptoms did get better at rest. But they also were triggered when she was exercising. Therefore, I told the patient that we did. I told her that she was going to be able to do some activity, but she was not able to do it. So I told her that she was going to be able to do some activity, but she was not able to do it. Her condition was serious. She's going to be getting vitals every two hours. Activity is as tolerated. As far as nursing interventions, she needs strict INOs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, maintaining her O2 stat above 96%. And she's also going to get an O2 nasal cannula. Diet-wise, she should be low sodium. IV fluid should be KVO, so just keeping that vein open. And then as far as medications, I instructed the patient. We were going to do a lot of work on her. We're going to be giving her a pain med. So that's acetaminophen, 625 milligrams by mouth. She can stay on her lisinopril, which is 10 milligrams by mouth daily. That's what she's already taking, and she will continue to. And then we're also adding furosemide, 40 milligrams by IV. She needs no type of diabetic intervention, no BiPAP. And for labs, I'm ordering serotroponins as well as a CMP. And she's going to be met by an interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist. And they are going to consult about an AICD. And then we're going to be doing a CRTD placement, a CRTD placement, doing a media-enhanced MRI, as well as an endomyocardial biopsy. The patient was instructed of all of this, that she would be admitted, doing additional labs and testing, that we were going to keep her on some medicine, as well as add a painkiller and a medicine that was going to improve her cardiac function. And the patient was agreeable to the plan. She stated she has a good support system at home, as well as insurance, and she was comfortable moving forward with this. Thank you. Thank you."
" All right. So the patient today was a 62 year old female named Leslie. She presented to the office with complaints of dyspnea and with dyspnea and fatigue. She stated that she was sick with a viral illness two weeks ago with fever, cough, chills, all of that sort of stuff. She started feeling better, but then she started having the shortness of breath symptoms and exercise intolerance. She said that she has trouble breathing when she's laying down and she's had to sleep in her recliner because she can't breathe. So she also has orthopnea. She would be considered an NYHA class two because she has slight restriction in her activity. She described her diet. She said that she has a diet as balanced. She denied illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol use, one cup a day of coffee. She was working out two times a week at the gym, but then she had to stop due to her symptoms. She's an elementary school teacher and she teaches the third grade and she's married. She has a past medical history of hypertension for which she's taking 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily. She has no known drug allergies. She had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago and the results of that were normal. Her mother passed away from breast cancer and her dad is 89 with dementia and he's in a nursing home right now. She talks about how she's gained eight pounds. She was having trouble breathing. She's wheezing. She felt like she was having heart palpitations. She's been on medication for a long time. She's been on medication for a long time. She has some symptoms as well as chest pain. Her vital signs. Her temp was good. Blood pressure was a bit high at 130 over 90. Her O2 sat was a bit low at 91 and her heart rate was a bit high at 110. Her chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly as well as a pulmonary infiltrate with pulmonary edema. Her troponin levels were raised at 0.1. And BMP levels were raised by 0.3. and P levels were raised at 4,000. Her EKG showed tachycardia, a left axis deviation, and a right bundle branch block. Her echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. All of this led me to believe that she had myocarditis due to that viral infection with dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. And I told her that we needed to admit her to telemetry, that we were going to add 625 grams of acetaminophen for pain control, as well as 40 milligrams of furosemide to get rid of some of the fluid. I'd like to repeat the troponins and also repeat the CMP since we started that furosemide. I'd like to consult with a radiologist to get a contrast MRI to see where the implant was. And I'd like to consult with a radiologist to get a contrast MRI to see where the implant was. And I'd like to consult with a radiologist to get a contrast MRI to see where the inflammation is in her heart. I'd also like to consult intermediate interventional cardiology to talk about placing a CRTD or an AICD. I'd also like to get a repeat on the 2D echo. And then I'd also like to consult infectious disease to see if we can figure out the cause of the virus that causes myocarditis. That is all. Thank you."
" Hello, today we have 62-year-old Ms. Palmer presenting to the ER with chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said she had flu-like symptoms two weeks ago, which included cough, runny nose, as well as a fever. These symptoms cleared up and then were followed by shortness of breath, fatigue, and a chest ache five days ago. She went to her PCP the same day, who told her to wait and see how the symptoms progressed. Today the symptoms became worse, so she came here to the ER. The patient reports that some exercise makes her chest ache worse, putting her in line with a New York Heart Association class of two. In contrast, sitting up makes the shortness of breath better, which is why the patient has been sleeping in a chair at night. She rates the pain as a 2 out of 10 and describes it as being dull in her chest and says that there is no radiation of the chest pain. The patient underwent a cardiac cath. She was diagnosed with a heart attack one year ago after she had an abnormal EKG, which found nothing out of the ordinary. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes the Cinepro. Her positive review of symptoms include fatigue, 8-pound weight gain over the last two weeks, achy and swollen lower legs, chest pain and palpitations, as well as some orthopnea. Her vitals are as follows. 130 over 90 blood pressure. 110. Heart rate. 20 respiration rates. 98.6 temperature. And 91.02 on room air. Physical exam was positive for JVD bilaterally, wheezing and rails bilaterally on auscultation, fetal edema, as well as a laterally displaced PMI. Her lab showed increased BMP and troponin. The chest x-ray indicated cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary edema. Her echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction less than 30%. EKG was normal sinus rhythm. Based on the symptoms and workup, I believe she has myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I suggest we admit her to telemetry, continue her lisinopril while adding acetaminophen and Lasix, and have interventional cardiology, infectious diseases, and radiology follow up on her. Additionally, I would like to administer IV fluids, a diet low in sodium, daily weight checks, DBT prophylaxis, oxygen by nasal cannula, maintaining oxygen sats over 96%, and activity as tolerated. We will perform serial troponins and the CMP as well as a repeat 2D echo to aid in care. Thank you."
" case of Leslie Palmer. He is a 69-year-old male presenting to the ER with a history of shortness of breath, fatigue, and some heart palpitations upon physical exercise. He states that he used to walk regularly with his friends, but is having trouble doing that due to shortness of breath. He also states he has been wheezing. He has been diagnosed with hypertension, which he takes lisinopril for. He has no known drug allergies. His current vitals are heart rate of 110, oxygen of 96. His BP was 130 over 90, and his temperature was 98.6. For his social history, he states he eats a well-balanced diet. He exercises regularly. He drinks a cup of coffee a day and denies alcohol. He is currently retired and sexually active in a monologous relationship. His family history did reveal that his mother died suddenly of an unknown cause at 40, and his father died of an MI at 59. Upon physical examination, he did reveal that he had positive JVD, a PMI that was displaced laterally, and you could hear wheezing and rails bilaterally upon oscillation. He also presented with lower extremities, and he was diagnosed with a low level of cardiomegaly. His X-ray results showed cardiomegaly, and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy. His left atrium was enlarged, and there was some hyperkinesia with an LVEF of 60%. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with tall R waves in the septal leads. In summary, Leslie Palmer presents with shortness of breath, heart palpitations, cardiomegaly, which points to a low level of cardiomegaly. He also presented with a low level of cardiomegaly, and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric to a familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And his NYHA scale was about a 2, because with some physical exercise would produce the symptoms. His condition is considered serious. He will have his vitals monitored every two hours. Activity as is tolerated, and nursing instructions are strict in and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, O2, and blood pressure. He also presented with a low level of cardiomyopathy, O2 via nasal cannula, maintain O2 stats above 96%. His diet is normal, and IV fluids are saving lock. His medications, we will discontinue lisinopril and initiate desopiramidine. We will also consult interventional cardiology for AICD placement, as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible future septal myoectomy or alcohol. He will also present with a low level of cardiomyopathy, and his diet is normal, injection to reduce LVOT. Thank you. Bye."
" So Mr. Palmer is a 62 year old male who presents to the ER today, complaining of shortness of breath that started two weeks ago while he was walking with some friends after work. He says while he was walking, it just kind of hit him suddenly and he got really short of breath. He felt really fatigued and he felt like his heart was racing. Um, he said after he rested, all his symptoms went away. But since then, every single time that he's done any bit of like, uh, light exercise, like moving around and walking like he did, um, he starts to get that shortness of breath. Um, he says he also will intermittently get the palpitations. Because of this, he went and saw his family medicine physician three days ago and, um, they did some labs and imaging. Um, and then I guess they got the results today and he said that he was called by them today and told to come to the ER so that we could evaluate him. Um, he doesn't have any other complaints. Um, he hasn't noticed any like swelling. Um, he hasn't noticed any like recent fever, chills, cough. Um, no recent rash. Uh, he hasn't been sweating with any of these events. Um, when he said his initial complaint has been the only thing that's bothered him. Um, he says something. Like this has never happened before. Um, uh, he doesn't complain of any chest pain right now, but about a year ago, he says that he did have a heart cath after he had, um, an abnormal EKG on like a routine physical. He said that, uh, his heart cath showed, uh, he had no blockages. So, um, he hasn't had any issues with that since then until this event. Um, he has a history of high blood pressure. He takes lisinopril, lisinopril 10 milligrams. Um, once a day for that. Um, he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, um, hasn't used any illicit drugs like cocaine ever in the past. Um, he's an elementary school teacher. He has a regular diet and he says that he regularly exercises every day after work. He'll go on a walk with his friends, but he hasn't been able to do that in the last two weeks because of his symptoms. Um, he's a family history is significant. Um, his father died of a heart attack, the age of 59 and his mother died unexpectedly, um, at the age of 40. He says he doesn't know why. Um, on physical, his, his tachycardic heart rate of 110. Um, he was hypertensive with, um, uh, blood pressure of 130 over 90. He says he has been taking his meds. He has a mistake doses. Um, he also says he doesn't have any medication allergies. Um, his O2 sat was 96 on room air. Um, he's awake alert, um, sitting comfortably. While I talked to him, he was able to lay down without any shortness of breath while I did his physical. Um, he didn't have any JVD or brewery, uh, karate brewery, um, or abdominal, uh, brewery or palpable aneurysm that I could feel. Um, his lungs were clear auscultation bilaterally. He, uh, had a regular rhythm on, um, while auscultating his heart. He did have an S4 murmur, uh, systolic, um, no rubs, but he did have the gallop. Um, he didn't have any chest wall tenderness. He didn't have any edema. He had good, strong DP and PT pulses. Um, his calves were equal in size and home and side was negative. Um, we're reviewing his, um, labs from the doctor's office. They did a troponin and a BNP on him. Both were normal. Um, his EKG had some, um, LBH, but it was, um, normal rhythm and rate. Um, on his chest x-ray, he had cardiomegaly, but his lungs were clear bilaterally. His airways were intact, trachea midline. Um, he didn't have any fractures. The only thing significant was cardiomegaly. Um, his echo, he had, um, an enlarged intraverticular. Inter ventricular septum, um, which I assume is why they sent him over. So, um, I told him we would admit him, um, put him on some oxygen just to get that up a little bit since his O2 sets like 96, that could be better. Um, and then we would have the interventional cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon follow up with him while he's in the hospital. Um, and we would start him on the dipyrrhoid beating instead of him taking it. Okay. Okay. Um, and then he's on, uh, exercise, um, restrictions until he's cleared by another physician. And he was agreeable to be admitted to telemetry."
" Hi there. I'd like to do a case presentation today on Ms. Palmer, a 62-year-old female came in today complaining of chest pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. Patient states that a week ago she'd been dealing with flu-like symptoms, specifically a cold, fever, and those had subsided. However, her fatigue has persisted since then. Patient has a past medical history of hypertension. She treats that with lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. Patient has a past surgical history of a cardiac catheter a year ago, was performed for having an abnormal EKG. Family history, mother has a history of breast cancer, passed away, no pertinent medical history from father. In terms of review of systems, patient has gained eight pounds in the last week, stated. Additionally, patient has palpitations that have been coinciding with her condition. Patient has a history of heart failure, chest pain recently, she stated. Patient has also noticed severe orthopnea as well when lying down and is not sleeping in a recliner, has also wheezing and coughing. And in terms of muscle pain, patient states that she has bilateral radiating muscle pain in her lower extremities as well. On physical exam, I noticed the patient's blood pressure was elevated at 130 over 90. Patient was also tachycardic at a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Upon auscultation, I noticed the patient had bilateral rails in her lungs. Additionally, patient had bilateral jugular venous distension as well. And she had bilateral pitting edema in her lower extremities. And in regards to my plan moving forward, I think Ms. Palmer should be admitted to the hospital, likely diagnosis being myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. I think Ms. Palmer should be admitted to the hospital, likely diagnosis being myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. And in regards to my plan moving forward, I think Ms. Palmer should be admitted to the hospital, likely diagnosis being myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So I was quite surprised seeing someone take risk tests with advisor services during a postpartum on wave one 12 and therefore, either with a senior or senior professional and at ritual IgE, so health procedures. The realistic HIV factors on a two times, broadly, more likely to be postpartum is mommy's Bible<|ms|> So, on your health and to the Committee have you of health support agrade tocription tracking so that you can incorporate the course for state and local medical facilities to support participant population's treatment of you So yeah. Psychology has been pods and and accessible for working erwary and the구 started a hybrid著 market with b2a and the Comförbe, speaking of minimum 살짝 with research labs adding furosemide as well to try and remove excess fluid from the patient. And additionally, using acetaminophen currently to decrease inflammation and limit any further cardiac damage. That's all I have for you. Thank you so much."
" presenting the patient that I saw, who was Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old male presenting with chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that the symptoms started a few weeks ago when he was with his friends. He started feeling lightheaded and like he was going to pass out. Patient is comfortable at rest, but has symptom onset when he performs physical activity, such as going for longer walks. He also notes heart palpitations and rasping. ROS was positive for fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, palpitations, wheezing, and dyspnea on exertion. Past medical history was significant for hypertension. Past surgical history was significant for a heart cath one year ago that turned up normal. Past family history, his mom passed away or died when she was 40 years old due to an unknown cause. It was a sudden death. His father passed away or died when he was 69 from a myocardial infarction. For social history, this patient does not drink, does not smoke, and does not use illicit drugs. He consumes a balanced diet and moderate caffeine. He exercises three to five times per week until the last few weeks. He has not been exercising due to his symptoms. He is a teacher and he lives with his husband. For medications, he takes lisinopril, 10 milligrams once daily for his hypertension. He has no known drug allergies. His vital signs were normal except for an elevated heart rate of 110. Physical health is not as important as physical health. He is not a exam was positive for jugular venous distension, biobasilar rails and wheezing, PMI displaced laterally, and one plus pinning edema in the lower extremities. Otherwise, the physical exam was normal. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. His labs were normal, including troponin and BNP. His echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement with left ventricular hyperkinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria with tall R-waves and deceptive leads. Based on these results and the patient's past medical history and his presenting symptoms, I believe that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I recommend that we admit him to telemetry. His condition is serious. I recommend that we take his vitals every two hours. He can do activity as tolerated. Nursing interventions include strict ins and outs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations over 96%. His diet can be regular. IV fluids keep vein open. For medications, I recommend we discontinue lisinopril and instead start disopiramide 100 milligrams four times daily. I recommend we consult with interventional cardiology to discuss AICD placement. I also recommend we consult with a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss possible septal myomectomy and alcohol injections. Thank you."
" I'm presenting to you Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old female who came into the hospital after her primary care doctor advised her to do so. She presented with a complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations, which occurred as a result of physical activity like walking or even getting up. When she moves at all, her symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath start to occur, and then a couple minutes later, with some rest, they'll go away. She'll occasionally wake up struggling to breathe, and occasionally she'll have shortness of breath if she's laying down flat, but if she sits up, she gets better. She has a past surgical history of getting a heart cath a couple years ago, but she's never been hospitalized. She takes lisinopril, timilogram, and tazepramine. She's on prednisone, 10 milligram currently, and she has no allergies. Her past medical history includes high blood pressure and sarcoidosis. Her medical issues have been handled relatively well until her new issues arise. Her father passed away of sudden unexplained death a few years ago, and her mother had a heart attack at 59. She doesn't smoke, use tobacco, or elicit drugs. Currently, she's an elementary school teacher who has been able to continue working and eat healthy food. She's on a healthy, balanced diet. She used to walk daily, but recently she hasn't been able to walk as often due to her issues. My review of systems found that she had gained 8 pounds in the past week and had swelling in her legs. She also had the issues of dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, and palpitations. The remaining review of symptoms were negative. I performed a physical exam and found wheezing and lower extremity edema. Her lab test showed an elevated BMP. Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema with mediastinal fullness, but no altered cardiac silhouette. An echocardiogram showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with an enlarged wall and a slightly decreased ejection fraction. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia. After her appointment, I would like to diagnose her with sarcoidosis. I also had her take a test for sarcoidosis-restricted cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III, and secondary hypertension and secondary pulmonary sarcoidosis. I ordered her to be admitted to telemetry with vitals every two hours, out of bed with assistance, strict I.O., daily weight, and nasal cannula to maintain an O2 saturation of 96%. She also went to the hospital. She was hospitalized for a week. She also will get daily weight, a low-sodium diet, saline-locked KVO for fluids. She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg, and I will increase her prednisone dosage to 60 mg. And then I'll add amiodarone 150 mg and furosemide 40 mg via IV. She will get a repeat CMP to check her blood pressure. She will see an interventional cardiologist to consider putting in an AICD. She will also see a nuclear medicine radiologist to get an FDG PET scan to look for further issues."
" Case presentation on a new patient, Mr. Palmer. He's a 62-year-old male presenting with a chief complaint of dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue that started six months ago. It has gotten worse over the past three days. The patient went to their family medicine doctor. They ran a couple of tests, and the family medicine referred him to the emergency department. He has a history of hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, and AFib, which he takes lisinopril, metoprolol, succinate, metformin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and warfarin for. He has no known drug allergies. He has gained a couple of pounds in the past two weeks and also has bouts of palpitations. He also mentioned swelling in his ankle. He has a surgical history of a triple coronary artery bypass and five coronary stents put in. Regarding his social history, he has a history of tobacco use, smoking one pack per day for the last 30 years. He also drinks one cup of coffee a day. He currently lives with his wife and is generally active and walks regularly, but he has not been able to do so recently. Regarding his family, his mother is deceased and passed away from breast cancer at 80, and his father is currently in a facility for Alzheimer's. Now, in regards to his vitals, temperature was 98.6. Heart rate was 90. Respiratory rate was 22, and blood pressure was 80 over 50. And oxygen sap was 86%. Cardiopulmonary and physical exam showed positive JVD, tachycardia, gallop, rails, and wheezing, all as present. The patient showed no signs of carotid or abdominal buoy. He had pedal edema and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis. Pulses were full bilateral. They were equal. His labs showed elevated troponin and BNP at 4,000. X-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echoes showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at 30%. And the patient claimed that prior imaging showed that he had an ejection fraction of 40%, so now it is lower. And EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis, and left bundle branch block. Hormone sign, testing for DVT was negative. At this point, ischemic dilatation. And the patient's cardiac cardiomyopathy was suspected. So I spoke to him about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about his social support and insurance. At this time, he will be admitted to the ICU. Vitals will be taken every two hours. And activity instructions are strict bed rest. Nursing interventions include strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and BiPAP 16 over 6, FiO2 at 50% for respiratory therapy. Diet is limited. Low sodium and KVO lock. Medication will include clopidogrel 75 milligrams four times a day. Warfarin 2.5 milligrams two times a day. And dobutamine IV drip. The patient will also receive an insulin sliding scale for their diabetes. Serial troponin and PT-INR will also be ordered. He will be consulted by an interventional cardiologist for possible AICD and CRTD placement. The patient claimed they had transportation to hospital."
" All right. So a patient named Leslie Palmer presents complaining of an onset of fatigue, dyspnea, as well as orthopnea that's been present even at rest. And it's been getting even worse for the past six months. After this, a review system was taken. And the general review systems noted fatigue as well as a weight gain of about eight pounds. Musculoskeletal review system indicated lower extremity edema. And the EENT was negative for anything. Pulmonary test indicated dyspnea as well as orthopnea. Neurotest was negative. Skin test was negative as well as cardio test was also negative. After this, a surgical history was taken in which the patient was noted to have previously had a triple bypass cardiac surgery as well as a stent placement. The medications that the patient was on was lisinopril 10 milligrams, metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams, atorvastat 10 milligrams, metformin 500 milligrams, furosemide 20 milligrams, and colpidogrel 75 milligrams. There was no noted allergies. As for the social history, the patient noted that his food intake was very balanced. His exercise routine, the patient noted that he used to like to walk. However, now that the dyspnea and orthopnea has gotten even worse, it's too difficult to do these activities. So he does not exercise. As for drugs, there is no drug use or illicit drug use. There is no drug use. There is no other. The patient has been smoking tobacco for the last 30 years or has been smoking for the last 30 years. The patient has no alcohol intake. However, as for caffeine, the patient does drink one cup of coffee a day. And it's also as for the occupation, the patient is a schoolteacher and the patient is sexually active. As for past hospitalizations, the patient had a hospitalization for the triple bypass surgery as well as stenting. As for the family history, the mother was noted to have died from breast cancer and the father is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease. As for the past medical history for the patient, this includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, as well as atrial fibrillation. The vital signs were also noted. The blood pressure was 80 over 50, which was total. The blood pressure was 80 over 50, which was total. The blood pressure was 80 over 50, which was total. The blood pressure was 80 over 50, which was total. The ratto lines were observed to the patient as being too low. Pulse was 90, which is good. The respiratory rate was 22, which is noted, which the patient is being too high. The temperature was noted as 98.6 degrees Farenheit, which was noted as being normal. The respiratory rate was noted as 98.6 degrees Farenheit, which was noted as being normal. O2 saturation was known to be 86%, which was noted as being abnormal and too low. O2 saturation was known to be 86%, which was noted as being abnormal and too low. O2 saturation was known to be 86%, which was noted as being abnormal and too low. Going through the physical examination, both radial pulses incline and a flat Avenue gain. Going through the physical examination, both radial pulses incline and a flat Avenue gain. were present. However, the pedal pulse and posterior tibialis pulse was not taken. There was a positive JVD. Bibasilar rails were also noted on lung auscultation. There was also a pitting edema that was noted. After the physical examination, the labs were examined and discussed with the patient. This included CBC and CMP, which were both normal. However, troponin was elevated, which was told to the patient as being a sign of potential cardiac damage. BNP was also elevated, which was told to the patient as being a sign of possible cardiac heart failure. And chest x-rays showed signs of pulmonary edema, as well as cardiomegaly. EKG also showed a left bundle branch block, as well as a left axis deviation, and a normal sinus rhythm. Also, a non-reentrant ventricular tachycardia was noted to the patient. However, that was incorrect. After this, a diagnosis was made of a New York-scale type for ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to breathing difficulty and severe symptoms, increased bilmiyorum infection, menopause,sticks in the respiratory system, and breast cancer, the patient received a wide range of and quantitative implications show a significant improvement in hisnte preconception. This tasker was identified with HIV manuscript and wrestling for this on December 1, 2014. управon causes a到 5%, death rate of 8%, and menopause more than 90%.

Varietal traits such as post-traumatic stress and typhoid duodenum. to fight off possible cardiogenic shock, as well as adding an insulin sliding scale for the diabetes. Also, it was told to the patient that interventional cardiology would be consulted with for a possible AICD and CRPD placement. CRPD was not noted to the patient. However, AICD was noted to the patient. After this, the labs that needed to be taken were not noted to the patient. The labs that do need to be taken are serial troponin, as well as IV INR, are two labs that need to be taken after this. Yeah, that's it. All right. Thank you so much. Also, with that, this was not noted to the patient, but the patient needs to be put on a BiPAP. BiPAP, 50%. Okay. 50% FiO2 and 16 by 60 for the BiPAP for oxygen saturation."
" to you today. So I had just finished seeing Mrs. Palmer. She's a 62 year old woman who presents to the emergency department today with complaints of cough, shortness, excuse me, with complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain and fatigue. She claims that a couple of few days ago, she had a viral infection for which she had cough. She had fever and just general malaise. She saw her primary care physician for which she says that the symptoms resolved, except for her shortness of breath and fatigue. And currently she's experiencing chest pain. As of now, she does not have a fever, but she does have shortness of breath and fatigue. When I asked her what aggravates the shortness of breath, she says that any daily activities like walking around really makes her feel the shortness of breath and fatigue, but sitting in a reclined seat. So like sitting in her recliner alleviates her symptoms. She also describes the chest pain as just dull chest pain. When I asked her about her past medical history, she told me that she has a history of hypertension for which she takes a Cinepro 10 milligrams a day. She does not have any known allergies, neither to any food or medication. When I asked her for past hospitalization, she claims that she had a catheter cardiac catheterization placed one year ago. Her family history, her mother passed away with breast cancer and her father's currently in an assisted living facility dealing with Alzheimer's. When I asked her about her social history, specifically her diet, she claims that she has a low balanced diet, that she eats a lot of meats, vegetables, and a lot of other foods. She claims that she has a low balanced diet, that she eats a lot of meats, vegetables, fruits and vegetables. She also claims for her caffeine intake, that she only takes one cup of coffee, no alcohol, no tobacco use. And she does not take illicit drugs. Exercise wise, she used to be able to go to the gym twice a week, but now with her shortness of breath, she's not able to do that. And her living situation is that she lives currently with her husband and she is a school teacher for her occupation. Now, when going through the medical system and what is included in theistics framework, our nervous system is Babke self balance in terms of hacks, angles, weight, weight gain structure, numbers, so on and so forth. All self balance is divided into three elements through the review of systems, and everyday self balance levels are better in your hineal system. Siobhan says that her postnatal symptoms are great. Seasonality improvements are positive, overall heath, overall ​​I just wanted to share the summarize of her in terms of psychological settings Hi Sanler Hi Sanler Deaf must havedz today AFT Diabetes 토�ba She completed a daily self balance, here going through the review of systems, for general review system. Everything was negative except for an 8-pound weight gain, within the last two weeks. All skin review systems were negative. All HEATS review systems were negative. dyspnea and orthopnea. For cardiac, the only thing that she claims positive was palpitation and chest pain. And for MSK, the only thing that she claimed that she reported was swelling of her legs and muscle aches. All else were negative. So for her physical exam, her vitals, her heart rate was 110, which was a little bit elevated. Her blood pressure was 130 over 90 as well, elevated and elevated. And excuse me, her temperature was 98.6 and O2 saturation was 91%. Physical exam findings, she had a positive JVD. She had bi-basilar wheezing, edema in her leg, and her PMI was displaced laterally. When I looked at her lab, she had elevated troponin and BNP. Her chest x-ray did show edema and cardiomegaly, and her EKG showed premature ventricular contractions, left, excuse me, left atrial deviation, right bundle branch block, and sinus tachycardia. So I reviewed the labs with the patient. I reviewed the chest x-ray with the patient. I reviewed her EKG, as well as her echo and her echo did show dilated left ventricular wall dilation with decrease of fusion rate, which is around 30%. So I explained all her labs to her. I went over the labs, chest x-ray, EKG, and then we went with the plan. And so I told her, considering her condition, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her, that she did have a viral infection in the past few days, and all her signs pointed to dilated cardiomyopathy. I do believe this is myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy. So her symptoms were due to her previous viral infection. So due to that, I'm going to place her for us and I to be able to get rid of the edema she has in her legs and in her lungs. I also want to continue her listen for blood pressure. I'm going to give her acetaminophen for her chest pain. Labs wise, I'm going to repeat troponin to be able to get rid of the edema she has in her legs. To see if it improves, and we're going to repeat an, excuse me, repeat an echo. I also recommended that we add a cardiologist and intervention, interventional cardiologist to the team, to be able to see if she's a candidate for a defibrillator, and add a radiologist to the team, and infectious disease specialist. So with all that, I do believe the patient does have hopeful outcomes. And I explained, I also explained to her that she was on board with the plan. She had social support at home, and that she did have insurance to be able to cover the cost of all this. I also told her that we would be admitting her to the telemetry floor and not the ICU. So admit to the telemetry floor. And then I also lastly explained to her that myocarditis was probably due to the viral infection she had before. The patient stated that she understood everything. She did not have any questions at the moment and agreed with her plan. And that was my encounter for today. With the lovely Mrs. Palmer, and I hope for the best. Thank you so much."
" I just finished meeting with Leslie Palmer. She's a 62 year old female who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue. She mentioned this started three weeks ago when she had a cold. She said the chest pain was on her left side, just above her left breast and rated it as dull, constant and achy and a two out of 10. She said it did not radiate anywhere. And for the shortness of breath, she said it was relieved by sitting up and bothered her more while lying down. She was awake alert oriented, but I didn't know she was fatigued. Her vitals were a heart rate of one 10. So slightly elevated a respiratory rate of 20 oxygen sats at 91%, which I told her was low and her respiratory rate slightly high, probably as a compensation for that. Her temperature was normal at 98.6 and her blood pressure was slightly elevated at one 30 over 90. However, she does have a history of hypertension. So that may be normal. For her general review of systems, she had fatigue and a weight gain of 10 of eight pounds. Everything else was negative. Her skin heat and neuro review of systems were all negative for her cardio. She had chest pain and palpitations, but no near syncope and for her pulmonary review of systems, she had wheezing dyspnea and orthnea. And for her MSK, she had a lower extremity edema that she mentioned. So as I said, her past medical history is positive for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams orally every day. She has no surgical history or hospitalizations or no known drug allergies. Her mother passed away at 80 years old of breast cancer. Her father is currently 89, who is living in a care facility with Alzheimer's. For her personal social history, she eats a well-balanced diet. She says she was exercising regularly up until the chest pain and shortness of breath. And she has a lot of pain in her chest. And she has a lot of pain in her chest. And she has a lot of pain in her chest. So she is not currently exercising. She denies any drugs, tobacco or alcohol use and drinks one cup of coffee per day. Her occupation is an elementary school teacher and she lives with her husband who she's married to. I asked her about the shortness of breath for which she said it occurs at rest. So that would be a grade four and why age scale on physical exam. I noted that she was positive. For example, she was positive for jugular venous distension. She did not have any breweries. Her heart rate was regular with no murmurs, regurgitations or gallops. Her PMI was displaced laterally. She did not have any chest wall tenderness, but on auscultation, she did have five basilar rails and wheezing on her lower extremity exam. I noticed plus one pitting edema in the calves. Her calves were not tender and her pulses were full and normal. Going over her lab work with her, I noted her troponins were high as well as her BMP was elevated at 4,000. Her chest x-rays showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema and her echo showed a dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. The EKG showed sinus tack, which was consistent with the monitor we had on her and a right bundle branch block. So based on the physical exam history and lab work, I diagnosed myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So we are admitting her to the hospital with telemetry serious condition. So we are going to check vitals every two hours activity. I left as tolerated for nursing interventions, strict input output, maintaining daily weight and DVT prophylaxis and putting a nasal cannula on to maintain her oxygen sats above 96 for IV fluids. We're going to add furosemab, which is a very common drug in the US. And then we're going to add a lot of other drugs. So we're going to add a lot of other drugs. So we're going to add a lot of other drugs. I was prescribed at 40 milligrams, IV to help with the pulmonary edema. And so I left IV fluid status as keep veins open. I prescribed 625 milligrams of oral acetaminophen for the pain and told her she could continue her 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily for her cardiovascular system. No other respiratory therapy besides the nasal cannula for lab orders. And so I was not able to handle the6 This is a less than I get. The IV fluid were on a par front. So I was relatively fine.

" So patient is Mr. Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old male with history of hypertension. He is presenting with shortness of breath and fatigue that started two weeks ago and is worsening. Patient states that he was walking with his friends when he felt symptom onset. On set, patient takes lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day because of his hypertension. He says that he's compliant with his medications. He did not take his lisinopril before coming to see us today. He describes his shortness of breath and fatigue as generalized. Symptoms are exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. At rest, he is okay. He can breathe normally. Symptoms are intermittent and is range 7 out of 10. For ROS, positives were wheezing, presyncope, fatigue, and palpitations. His vitals were 130 over 90. For blood pressure, heart rate 110, O2 sat 96, which he will be put on a nasal cannula, which I told him. And temperature was 98.6. Patient has surgical history of a cardiac cath that was done one year ago, which came back normal at the time. Pertinent familial history is his father died from an MI of 59 and mother died from sudden cardiac death at 40. Physical exam findings were positive for systolic murmur, which is a symptom of a heart attack. His blood pressure was 110.0. He was a patient with an S4. PMI was laterally displaced, and there was a gallop herd. There's no JVD, no carotid bruit herd. Lungs were clear to oscillation bilaterally, and abdomen showed no bruit or no pulsatile masses. There was no edema in the lower extremities. Prophyl pulses were present, equal bilaterally. The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. The echo showed a thickened interventricular septum with left ventricular, um, hypertrophy and left atrium enlargement. There was global hyperkinesia with direct infraction of 60%. EKG showed a left ventricular hyper, left ventricular hypertrophy with a large R wave and septal leads. Um, and it had a normal sinus rhythm. Patient states he's a well-balanced diet. He walks daily, exercises daily. He denies tobacco or illicit drug use, no alcohol use. Patient is a school teacher and married for 35 years with his wife.

" Hi, Leslie, a 62-year-old elementary school teacher, presented today with worsening tiredness and shortness of breath over the past two months. Dyspnea occurs with most activity, but it improves with rest. Her medical history included hypertension, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and she had a surgical history of cardiac catheterization. Her parents had a history of sudden death and myocardial infarction, and she currently lives with her husband. She's currently on lisinopril, 10 milligrams four times a day, and prednisone, 10 milligrams four times a day. During the physical exam and review of systems, I found fatigue, weight gain, jugular venous distension, palpitations, murmur, gallop, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, rails, and lower extremity edema. The lab results showed ventricular tachycardia, normal sinus rhythm, mediastinal fullness, and pulmonary edema. My assessment is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and the plan includes telemetry admission with vital signs checked every two hours, assisted ambulation, low-sodium diet with strict monitoring, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, oxygen maintenance, and daily weight checks. Regarding medication, I want to continue with lisinopril and increase prednisone to 60 milligrams four times a day, and I also want to administer amiodarone and, for us, amide intravenously. Amiodarone for 150 milligrams and for us, amide for 40 milligrams. I would like to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel as well due to the for us, amide usage. And for consultations, I would like to consult interventional cardiology for AICD placement and radiology for FDG PET scan."
" Leslie Palmer is a 62-year-old female patient who came to the emergency department today complaining of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue for two months. She also reported an incident of palpitations and presyncope two months ago, which occurred in her home. Three days ago, the patient was seen by her primary care physician for her symptoms, but when these symptoms worsened today, she was advised to go to the emergency room. Today, she reports of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, and wheezing that occur with most activities and are relieved only with rest. She sleeps sitting up in a recliner to help with her breathing when she sleeps. Her symptoms have not been relieved by any medications or interventions thus far. Patient history is positive for hypertension, sarcoidosis, for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams daily. She denies any allergies to medications. Her family has been working with her to make sure that she is healthy and that she is healthy. She also reports having a cardiac catheterization performed one year ago, with all results normal at that time. The patient denied any history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. She reported having a balanced diet with one cup of daily coffee and used to walk daily with friends prior to the onset of her current symptoms. She lives at home with her husband and works at a restaurant. She has been on a diet for a long time, but she has not been able to eat or sleep well. She is a 5th grade teacher. Additional symptoms reported include 8-pound weight gain in 2 weeks' time and lower extremity swelling. Skin, heat, and neurological symptoms and systems were all negative. Patient's vitals today read as having a blood pressure of 136 over 99, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, though fatigued. and was seated leaning forward at the start of the exam. Carotid bruise were negative, but jugular venous distension was present upon examination. Cardiac exam revealed a systolic murmur with an S4 gallop, and lung exam revealed rails and wheezing bilaterally. Her abdominal screening was negative. Bilateral pinning edema of the lower extremities was also observed with the patient denying any pain. Osteopathic screening revealed ropiness at the levels of T4 through T6 on the right side of the patient's thoracic spine. This patient's labs were significant for an elevated BNP. Echocardiogram revealed a restrictive cardiomyopathy, and chest x-ray showed pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally with mediastinal fullness. EKG showed a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. This 62-year-old patient with a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis has major presenting problems of progressive dyspnea and fatigue with additional symptoms of palpitations and presyncope. The most likely diagnosis is restrictive myocardopathy due to sarcoidosis. I recommended admitting the patient to telemetry for full-time cardiac observation in addition to consulting interventional cardiology for possible AICD placement and radiology for FDG PET scan. For medications, I recommended with continuing her lisinopril, increasing her prednisone dosage to 60 mg, and adding IV furosemide and IV amiodarone. The patient consented with this plan."

" case of cardiac sarcoidosis. The patient presented in the clinic this morning feeling fatigued, shortness of breath, and fluttering of the chest for the past two months. She was seen by her primary care provider, and it prompted her a visit to the ER. Her shortness of breath is worse when lying down, and she's experiencing near-sickness. Upon doing a review of systems with the patient, she reported feeling fatigued, has experienced an eight-pound weight gain over the past couple of weeks, and is experiencing palpitations on top of the single P. It's especially exaggerated whenever she exerts herself and whenever she lies down, so orthopenia, and has noticed some edema in her legs. The patient has a history of hypertension, for which she takes 10 milligrams of leucine perilla a day, and has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, for which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams a day, and she has a previous cardiac catheterization history.

" female patient, Ms. Leslie Palmer, who came into our emergency clinic for shortness of breath. Two weeks ago, this patient experienced a cough, fever, runny nose, and dull pain in their chest. That illness has since resolved, but their shortness of breath has either gotten worse or just not gotten better. The patient is in our emergency department after seeing their family care practitioner three days ago, and they were encouraged to come into the ER as their shortness of breath did not improve. The patient has experienced dyspnea and orthopnea, only relieved by sitting or sleeping in their recliner. The patient is also experiencing chest pain, pressure, and a dull ache in their chest. Pain is constant and rated as a 2 out of 10. The patient has also experienced an increase in 8-pound weight gain, over the past week or so, along with the experiencing fatigue and fever, but no chills. The patient is also experiencing muscle aches, but no headaches, no neck tenderness or no neck tightness, no dizziness, no confusion. Along with the chest pain, the patient is also experiencing palpitations and fluttering in her chest, but no presynchro episodes. For past medical history, the patient has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years that's been well controlled. The patient is taking lecithinopril for the hypertension, 10 milligrams one time per day, and is diligent with her medication. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient one year ago did go for a cardiac catheterization for an abnormal EKG, but the catheterization showed no remarkable findings, no previous hospitalizations, and no pertinent medical history from her mom or dad or siblings. The patient is up to date with her current immunizations. The patient has no history of less drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use, one cup of coffee every morning, along with before this current episode of illness, exercised regularly and was on a balanced diet. For my physical exam, I found the patient to have jugular venous distension bilaterally. Every just a you are metal scraping down yourку w. log of öl kno bilateral, strong, and equal. For the patient's vitals, heart rate is 110. The respiratory rate is 20, temperature of 98.6, blood pressure of 130 over 90, and pulse oximeter of 91%. For the chest x-ray, the patient's chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. The Doppler or the 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an injection fraction of less than 30%. Labs came back with elevated troponin and elevated brain natriuretic peptide at 4,000. And EKG showed sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, left atrial, sorry, left axis deviation, along with a premature ventricular contraction. So I would like to admit this patient to the hospital for myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy. I'd like to admit to telemetry for constant cardiac monitoring. Patient's condition is serious. No known drug allergies for the patient. Vitals, I would like vitals taken every two hours. Activity as tolerated for the patient. Nursing orders, strict IO, daily weights taken, DVT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula, to make sure that her O2 saturation stays above 96%. For diet while she's in the hospital, I'd like low sodium and oral fluid restriction. I'd like to get a saline lock set up to keep the vein open. For medications, I want the patient to continue their lisinopril, 10 milligrams once per day. I want to start the patient on acetaminophen, 625 milligrams every six hours, along with starting furosemide IV, 40 milligrams. I'd like the following labs ordered, troponin, continuous troponin levels. I'd like a CMP ordered for electrolytes and a repeat echo, 2D echo, to get an image of the heart. I'd also like to consult three different physicians on interventional cardiology to talk to the patient about an implantable cardiac defibrillator, along with a resynchronization device for those to be placed for the patient. And also while we're doing that, I'd like to get an endomyocardial heart transplant. I'd like to get an endomyocardial heart transplant biopsy to determine the infectious agent. Then I'd like to talk to infectious disease as far as starting the patient on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids. And I'd also like to consult the radiologist to get a contrast media enhanced MRI to get a clear, higher resolution picture of the heart. Okay. If you have any questions, please let me know."
" Okay. Hi, Dr. Rollins. I just saw Leslie Palmer in room seven. He is a 62-year-old male who presents today with dyspnea and fatigue with more than ordinary movement for the past two weeks. He also notes some palpitations and wheezing with exertion, but denies any chest pain. He said resting resolves his symptoms and he is comfortable at rest. He denies any recent illness prior to two weeks ago. His active medical conditions include hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. He denies any prior hospitalizations, but surgical history includes a cardiac catheter one year ago. He had not received any results from it, but when his recent symptoms began, he called the office and they told him they did not find anything. And so they referred him here. He's married and lives with his spouse. He is sexually active and is in a monogamous relationship. He knows he has a balanced diet and denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He has one cup of coffee every day. Prior to two weeks ago, he walked daily with a group, which he considered a social activity for him as well. And he would like to get back to doing that. He is also a sixth grade teacher. He told me that his father died at the age of 59 from a myocardial infarction and his mother died suddenly at the age of 40. His physical exam showed no edema, negative home insecurity, and no symptoms. He is a physical examist. He is a physical examist. He has a non-tender chest with palpation. He has a systolic murmur and laterally displaced PMI. His lungs are clear to oscillation bilaterally. I evaluated Chapman's points, heart changes, and thoracic spine and did not find any osteopathic findings. He did not have any JVD or carotid breeze. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and his echo showed left ventricle asymmetric ejection fraction of 60. His EKG showed a low level of osteopathy, but his chest x-ray showed normal sinus rhythm, tall R waves in the septal leads, and left ventricular hypertrophy. His labs were all negative. From my findings, I believe he is suffering from NYJ class 2 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I explained to him that I believed it had a genetic cause. I recommended that we admit him to telemetry and consider consult with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myomectomy and alcohol injection. I also believe that we should discontinue his lisinopril and switch him to disapiramide and keep his activity as tolerated. Thank you."

Her vitals are a heart rate of 110, blood pressure of 130 over 90, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She states that she had visited her PCP three days ago with similar complaints and was told to go to the ER if her symptoms persisted. The patient states that around two weeks ago, she felt sick with a fever and cough. She thought she had had a cold because her symptoms had resolved within five days, but the feeling of breathlessness and fatigue remained. She admits that she feels a dull and achy discomfort and feels out of breath during slight exercise, which improves with rest. The patient admits that sleeping supine makes her symptoms worse, causing her to sleep on her recliner. She denies taking any other medications to improve her symptoms. She admits that she has a cold, but she feels sick with a fever and cough. She is an elementary school teacher and thinks that she could have gotten sick from school. She is currently taking lisinopril 10 mg daily for her hypertension with no allergies and is up to date with her immunizations. Mrs. Leslie has had a cardiac cath procedure done one year ago with no hospitalizations. She admits that her mother has unfortunately passed away due to breast cancer, while her father is currently living in a nursing facility suited for Alzheimer's. Mrs. Leslie is also married. Currently, she denies any fever or chills, but states that she has... Notice an eight-pound weight gain. She denies any new rashes, lesions, bruising, or any other skin changes. She also denies any new onset of headaches, hearing or vision changes, difficulty swallowing, neck stiffness, or neck stiffness. The patient admits to heart palpitation and slight chest discomfort, stating it as dull and achy, but denies any presyncope. She states that she does not have a cough, but has noticed a new onset of wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, which she improves by sleeping on her recliner. The patient denies joint and back pain, but admits to muscle aches and some leg swelling. In terms of Mrs. Leslie's social history, she has a balanced diet and has been able to exercise twice a week before her symptoms started. She denies any illicit substance use, tobacco, or alcohol use, and her caffeine intake consists of drinking one cup of coffee every day. During her physical exam, she has, I noticed, JVD with no carotid bruise. A regular rate with no murmurs, friction rub, or gallops. On cardiac auscultation, she does have a laterally displaced PMI with no chest tenderness. On long auscultation, she has bilateral rails and wheezing present. Exam of her extremities show non-tender calves, a negative Hohmann sign, plus one fetal edema with the DP and PT pulses full and equal bilaterally. Her OMIM screen showed no significant heart changes, and her Chapman points were not tender. I discussed with Mrs. Leslie that her heart rate was low. Her heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were slightly elevated, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema. Her 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricle ejection fraction of less than 30%, while her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I also advised that her lab values were triponin. Her O2 saturation and BNP were elevated, with BNP being at 4,000. I would place the patient as a near-heart association functional classification of 2 with a slight limitation of physical activity, while also admitting the patient to telemetry since her condition is serious, and place a consult with the interventional cardiologist to consult for an AICD-CRTD placement and endomyocardial biopsy. With infectious disease, consults are required. I would also advise that her heart rate was low, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation with a left bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I would also advise that her heart rate was low, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation with a left bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I would also advise that her heart rate was low, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation with a left bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I would also advise that her heart rate was low, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation with a left bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I would decide that her heart rate was low, and advised supplemental oxygen to increase her O2 saturation with a left bundle, branch block, and left axis with premature ventricular contractions. I would also advise that what bee suture is a firm 쉬 that various vitamin G uminides were devoted to, to reduce her heart rate was equal to adding 10 milligrams or a cure every 12 hours to a patient understand dobrze Every six hours thirty six hours while continuing where center problem 10 milligrams daily the fierce of I would be two damages of at at least one study face mahi to reduce the congestion on her heart. Acetaminophen would be for her chest pain, chest discomfort, and lisinopril would be for her hypertension. I would also like to repeat labs, including CMP and serotroponin, given that we are to monitor her cardiac health and electrolyte levels, given that we are to be starting furosemide, as well as a repeat 2D echo to further evaluate her heart health."
" So I just met with Leslie Palmer. She is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents to the emergency department for the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. This patient states that approximately six months ago, she started experiencing these symptoms, even while she is at rest. She admits to dyspnea, unexertion, orthopnea, and wheezing. She also states that she's gained eight pounds within the past two weeks and that she noticed that her lower extremities are swollen. She denies chest pain or any palpitations. Three days ago, she saw her PCP, who did labs on her, and called her today and referred her to the emergency department, which is why she's here. She also states that she's been smoking one pack per day. She's been smoking one pack per day for the past 30 years. And then she also told me about her surgical history. So 12 years ago, she had bypass surgery. And then within the past five years, she's also had five stents. Her most recent stent was placed one year ago at her left anterior descending coronary artery. And her most recent echo, which was also one year ago, indicated that her left ventricular ejection fraction was at 40%. So that's a lot of information. So that's a lot of information. When I looked at her vitals, and even when walking into the room, she clearly looked to Kipnick. She showed that she had 22 breaths per minute. And she was also hypotensive at 80 over 50. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. So on physical exam, the patient was leaning over and gasping for breath. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. She had elevated troponin and BNP. Her troponin was 0.04, while her BNP was at 4,000. Her test x-ray indicated that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. And her echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. So that is a 10% decrease from last year's echo. When I was looking at her EKG, the most prominent finding was that she had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. And that was a bundle branch block, indicative of that S2 split. And she had a normal sinus rhythm. And her heart did have a left axis deviation and a left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. So based on her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue that's been worsening over the past six months, based off her physical exam and all of her imaging, I would say that she had a normal sinus rhythm. She has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She's class four for the New York standards of classification. Again, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. So I will admit her. I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU. I have consulted interventional cardiologists for possible automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator and or a cardioverter. And I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU. So I will admit her. I will admit her. I will admit her. I will admit her. And thank you so much for watching. And thank you so much for listening to my presentation."
" Leslie Palmer. Patient presents with shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that the symptoms began a couple weeks ago and has progressively became worse over the last two to three days. Symptoms are exacerbated with some exercise and only relieved by rest. Patient has not tried any other treatments besides rest and is helpful when he lays down. Yeah. Medication he's currently taking, he's currently taking include lisinopril, 10 milligrams. He is taking this for his diagnosis of hypertension. He is currently up to date on all immunizations and only hospitalization was a cardiac cath, which was, which turned out to be normal about a year ago. Failing medical history was normal on his mother's side and on his father's side. He, his father had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 59, myocardial infarction. Diet is balanced. Patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily. Caffeine intake was one cup a day. He is employed as a fifth grade elementary school teacher where he does have insurance through them. He is sexually active with his wife. When going over the review systems, patient has presented with a physician-led heart attack. He has been treated with a heart attack. He has been treated with a heart attack. He has been treated with a heart attack. He has been treated with a heart attack. The physical exam and findings included no jugular venous distention. He had a crescendo, decrescendo systolic murmur and with S4, the PMI was laterally displaced. Patient presented with no edema in the lower extremities and pulses were normal bilaterally. and lungs were clear on oscillation bilaterally. When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at zero, which is normal. BMP was at 90, which is normal. X-rays showed cardiomegaly. It did not show pulmonary infiltrates. ECHO showed a left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%. EKG showed tall septal R waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was a sinus rhythm. It was tachycardic. Patient did have a pulse of 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic. Oxygen saturation in the room was 96%. Restorative rate was at 16 breaths per minute, and ECHO showed a low pulse of 90 beats per minute. Temperature 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on the diagnostic labs and tests that were ordered, his physical exam and past medical history, I believe this patient has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I do suggest that we admit this patient to telemetry, and we stop the lisinopril, start him on 100 milligrams of disopiramide, and then we do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. We do a test. I also believe that we should refer Mr. Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we possibly can implant an AICD placement. I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery for alcohol injections and septomyotomy to reduce the left ventricular outflow. tract obstruction."
