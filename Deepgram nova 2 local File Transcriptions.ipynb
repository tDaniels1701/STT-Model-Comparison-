      "                            \"transcript\": \"\\nSo I just met with Leslie Palmer. She is a 62 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents to the emergency department for the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. This patient states that approximately 6 months ago, she started experiencing these symptoms, even while she is at rest. She admits to dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and wheezing.\\n\\nShe also states that she's gained \\u00a38 within the past 2 weeks and that she noticed that her lower extremities are swollen. She denies chest pain or any palpitations. 3 days ago, she saw her PCP who did labs on her and called her today and referred her to the emergency department, which is why she's here. She also states that she's been smoking 1 pack per day for the past 30 years, And then she also told me about her surgical history. So 12 years ago, she had bypass surgery.\\n\\nAnd then within the past 5 years, she's also had 5 stents. Her most recent stent was placed 1 year ago at her left anterior descending coronary artery, and her most recent echo, which was also 1 year ago, indicated that her left ventricular ejection fractional was at 40%. When I looked at her vitals, and even when walking into the room, she clearly looked to Kipnick. She showed that there was she had 22 breaths per minute, and she was also hypotensive at 80 over 50. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air.\\n\\nSo on physical exam, the patient was leaning over and gasping for breath. I saw, when I was auscultating her 4 posts, I saw that she was tachycardic with a split s 2, but I did not hear any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. When I was auscultating her lungs, I heard bibasilar reals. And then when I was assessing her lower extremity, I saw 1 plus pinning edema bilaterally, but her pulses were normal and equal bilaterally. When I was looking at her labs, she had elevated troponin and BNP.\\n\\nHer troponin was 0.04 while her BNP was at 4,000. Her test x-ray indicated that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and her echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. So it that is a 10% decrease, from last year's echo. When I was looking at her EKG, the most prominent finding was that she had a left bundle branch block, indicative of that s two split. And she had a normal sinus for them, and her her heart did have a left axis deviation, the left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria.\\n\\nSo based on her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, that's been worsening over the past 6 months, based off her physical exam and all of her imaging, I would say that she has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She's class 4 for the New York, standards of classification. Again, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema. So I will admit her. I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU.\\n\\nI have consulted interventional cardiologist, for possible automatic implantable cardiomerder defibrillator and or a cardiac resynchronization therapy, at this time. And thank you so much for listening to my presentation.\",\n",

Patient states that the symptoms began a couple weeks ago and has progressively became worse over the last 2 to 3 days. Symptoms are exacerbated, with some exercise and only relieved by rest patient. Has not tried any, patient has not tried any other treatments besides rest and is helpful when he, like, lays down. Medication he's currently taking he's currently taking, clobasopril 10 milligrams. He is taking this for his diagnosis of hypertension. He is currently up to date on autoimmuneizations, and only hospitalization, was a cardiac cath, which was, which turned out to be normal about a year ago. Family medical history was normal on his mother's side and on his father's side. He his father had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 59, myocardial infarction. Diet is balanced. Patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily. Caffeine intake was 1 cup a day. He is employed as a 5th grade allergen school teacher where he does have insurance through them. He is sexually active with his wife. When going over the review systems, patient has presented with, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea. I went ahead and then performed the physical exam. Physical exam and findings included, no jugular venous distension. He had a crescendo, decrescendo systolic murmur and with s 4. The PMI was laterally displaced. Patient presented with no edema in the lower extremities, and impulses were normal bilaterally, And lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally. When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at 0, which is normal. BNP was at 90, which is normal. X-ray showed cardiomegaly. It did not show pulmonary infiltrates. Echo showed a left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%. EKG showed tall septal r waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was a sinus rhythm. It was tachycardic. Patient did have a pulse of a 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic. Oxygen saturation, in the room was 96%. Respiratory rate was at 16 breaths per minute, and temperature, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on the, diagnostic labs that were ordered labs and tests that were ordered, his physical exam, and past medical history. I believe this patient had has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I do suggest that we admit this patient to, telemetry, and we stop the Lisinopril, start him on a 100 milligrams of Dasopyramide, every day by IV. I also believe that we should refer the mister Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we where we possibly can implant, an AICD placement. I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery, for alcohol injections and septomyectomy to, reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\",\n",

Patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily. Caffeine intake was 1 cup a day. He is employed as a 5th grade allergen school teacher where he does have insurance through them. He is sexually active with his wife.\\n\\nWhen going over the review systems, patient has presented with, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea. I went ahead and then performed the physical exam. Physical exam and findings included, no jugular venous distension. He had a crescendo, decrescendo systolic murmur and with s 4. The PMI was laterally displaced.\\n\\nPatient presented with no edema in the lower extremities, and impulses were normal bilaterally, And lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally. When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at 0, which is normal. BNP was at 90, which is normal. X-ray showed cardiomegaly. It did not show pulmonary infiltrates.\\n\\nEcho showed a left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%. EKG showed tall septal r waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was a sinus rhythm. It was tachycardic. Patient did have a pulse of a 110 beats per minute. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic.\\n\\nOxygen saturation, in the room was 96%. Respiratory rate was at 16 breaths per minute, and temperature, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on the, diagnostic labs that were ordered labs and tests that were ordered, his physical exam, and past medical history. I believe this patient had has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I do suggest that we admit this patient to, telemetry, and we stop the Lisinopril, start him on a 100 milligrams of Dasopyramide, every day by IV.\\n\\nI also believe that we should refer the mister Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we where we possibly can implant, an AICD placement. I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery, for alcohol injections and septomyectomy to, reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\",\n",

      " EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis, probably because of that cardiomegaly and then a lateral PMI.\n",
      " Left bundle branch block and, left ventricular hypertrophy, the voltage criteria was met.\n",
      " Chest x-ray shows edema, cardiomegaly.\n",
      " So we went ahead and diagnosed them with, ischemic, cardi excuse me.\n",
      " Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " It would, reduce ejection fraction 30%, gonna administer him to the ICU.\n",
      " It's a serious condition.\n",
      " We're gonna get his vitals checked for 2 hours.\n",
      " Strict eyes and nose, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, getting them on a BiPAP 16 over 6, 50%, saline with a KBO.\n",
      " Then a positive is, current meds right now except for the warfarin and clopidogrel.\n",
      " Go ahead and add a dobutamine drip drip because of that low blood pressure.\n",
      " And also his vitals showed a low blood pressure of 80 over 60, 80 over 50, excuse me, with a heart rate of 90, oxygen stats 86%.\n",
      " So that's why we wanna go ahead and get them on the BiPAP, dobutamine for that low blood pressure.\n",
      " Also, insulin stuff, keep track of those sugars, keep them stable.\n",
      " Go ahead and order more serial troponins to check how he's doing as well as PTI and R since he's on that warfarin.\n",

      " Bye.\n",
      ".\n",
      "So miss Leslie is a 62 year old female, presenting with dyspnea, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and a history of progressively worsening symptoms of palpitations and these show and these troubles breathing.\n",
      " This has been going on for the past 2 months, when she went and finally decided to see her family doctor 3 days ago to address these symptoms.\n",
      " The family doctor sent her away, and then she called the family doctor today, and he told or they told her to go and visit, the emergency department.\n",
      " Miss Leslie has a history of hypertension and pulmonary pulmonary sarcoidosis.\n",
      " Upon arriving, her vitals were taken, and she had a heart rate of 1 or a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 136 over 99, and a SPO 2 of 91.\n",
      " Her familial history is significant for sudden death of her mother at 40 and, father dying of a heart attack at 59.\n",
      " What she has no known drug allergies.\n",
      " She's currently on Lisinopril and prednisone as well as having no, substantial social history other than living with her husband and moderate caffeine usage.\n",
      " Miss Leslie used to exercise, fairly frequently until the past 2 months where she's been bedridden.\n",
      " Miss Leslie sleeps in a chair now because of her orthopnea, so it's easier for her to breathe in a recliner, so that's where she sleeps.\n",
      " And she has an NYHA, scale of 3, a heart rating of 3 as she has issues with any sort of, non resting activity.\n",
      " Upon that upon upon, Focus Physical Museum and diagnostic findings, we determined that miss Leslie, we believe she has pulmonary, not pulmonary, sarcoidosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " We saw that with an x-ray that had pathognomonic heor, lymph node findings as well as a few simple traits within the lungs and the large heart.\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      " Miss Leslie will be admitted to the hospital in serious condition.\n",
      " She will receive 2 liters of o two via nasal cannula as well as increasing her prednisone, keeping her own lisinopril, as well as adding amiodarone and, furosemide to relieve edema that she has from a buildup of water in her legs or a buildup of fluid in her legs.\n",
      " Furthermore, we consulted radiology for an FDG PET scan as well as interventional cardiology for a AICD automatic cardiac defibrillator in her heart.\n",
      " A, miss Leslie was put on a low salt diet, with an IV to keep open as well as I think that might be it.\n",
      " During our physical exam, miss Leslie did have, abnormal cardiac findings, including a murmur and a gallop at s 4, bi bibasilar rails, and that is it.\n",
      " So once again, we admitted her to the hospital, and we started treatment with furosemide, prednisone, continued lisinopril, and amiodarone to treat a, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia.\n",
      " So with that.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      " Mister Palmer is a 62 year old male who presented today with, dyspnea and fatigue after being referred to us by his family doctor.\n",
      " He noticed fatigue and dyspnea while walking 2 weeks ago, although he states that it is better with rest and better with laying down.\n",
      " The dyspnea and fatigue became worse last night, and he also reports a history of presyncope, palpitations, and wheezing.\n",
      " He has a medical history of hypertension for which he takes Lisinopril, and he takes no other medications.\n",
      " He has no allergies.\n",
      " He had a cardiac cath years ago, which came back normal.\n",
      " And he also has a family medical history of sudden death in his mother at 40.\n",
      " His father died of an MI in his fifties.\n",
      " He is an elementary school teacher who drinks 1 cup of coffee a day, no alcohol, no tobacco, and eats a balanced diet, and he enjoys going for walks every day.\n",
      " Although he has been, unable to do this recently due to the dyspnea and fatigue.\n",
      " For his vitals, I noticed a heart rate of 110, oxygen saturation of 96, blood pressure of 130 over 90, and a respiratory rate of 16, and a temperature of 98.\n",
      " On physical exam, I noted a crescendo, decrescendo murmur, and a displaced PMI, which I discussed with the patient.\n",
      " For his imaging on the X-ray, we saw a cardiomyopathy and cardiomegaly.\n",
      " On the echo, we saw hypertrophy of the septum, and, on the EKG showed septal hypertrophy with increased, amplitude waves in the leads, v 1, v 2, and v 3.\n",
      " So the, diagnosis, which I think is most likely for his case is familial hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, which I discussed with the patient, and I prescribed disopiroamide for her and discontinued his Lisinopril.\n",
      " I also referred him to an interventional cardiologist, which I discussed with the patient and as a cardiovascular surgeon.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Leslie presents today as a female patient for an evaluation of her shortness of breath, feeling like she's gonna pass out in a heart palpitations.\n",
      " She states she can't do anything.\n",
      " She reports this began 2 months ago and has worsened over the past 3 days.\n",
      " She was referred here today by her family medicine doctor who sought her 3 days ago.\n",
      " She notes fatigue and 8 pounds weight gain over the past week.\n",
      " Lower extremity edema significant palpitations over the past 2 months as well as wheezing and orthopnea over the past 2 months.\n",
      " Her past medical history includes hypertension and the diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis 25 years ago.\n",
      " She currently takes Lisinopril for the hypertension and prednisone for her recent medical issues.\n",
      " Patient currently lives with her husband who she describes as her social support, and she does have insurance.\n",
      " She currently works as an elementary school teacher.\n",
      " Prior to 2 months ago, she was an active walker.\n",
      " She states due to her symptoms, she is not able to do that now.\n",
      " Patient reports a healthy diet.\n",
      " She reports tachycardia or on the exam today, she had tachycardia at a heart rate of 110 and SpO 2 less than 95, hypertension at blood pressure 136 over 99, and a respiratory rate of 20.\n",
      " She's positive for jugular venous distension, negative for carotid roots, systolic s 4 present, gallop present, negative rubs, rails bilaterally, positive wheezing, plus 1 pitting edema.\n",
      " She had a bilateral lower extremity pulse and nontender calves.\n",
      " In summation, with the patient's history of sarcoidosis with positive exam findings as well as palmbroker sign and pulmonary edema on anterior posterior views on radiograph An echocardiogram displaying restrictive cardiomyopathy with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n",
      " Normal sinus rhythm with non sustained ventricular tachycardia on electrocardiogram, negative troponin, and a brain natriptide of 4,000.\n",
      " She has a diagnosis of sarcoidosis sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " Today, I stated that she was in New York Heart Association level 4, and this is a serious condition.\n",
      " So given these findings and her diagnosis, she will go to telemetry to be continue to be evaluated, And I will consult with an interventional cardiologist as well as a nuclear medicine or radiologist for further workup.\n",
      " She will continue Lisinopril to 100 milligrams every day.\n",
      " Amiodarone, a 150 milligrams intravenously.\n",
      " Prednisone will be increased to 60 milligrams every day and furosemide, 40 milligrams intravenously.\n",
      " Repeat bottles will be taken every 2 hours.\n",
      " And if she decides to get out of bed, she will need assistance.\n",
      " And that is my case presentation for Leslie.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Presenting with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " Her symptoms began 6 months ago when she visited and she visited her PCP 3 days ago.\n",
      " She reports that she cannot catch her breath, but states that there is no accompanying chest pain.\n",
      " She describes arthopnea in which reclining improves her symptoms and her symptoms worsen with activity.\n",
      " In terms of Leslie Palmer's past medical history, she has reported atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperellymphedema, diabetes, and her immunizations are up to date.\n",
      " In terms of past surgical history, she reports a previous cardiac stent.\n",
      " In fact, there have been 5 cardiac stents, and she's no longer a candidate for any future ones.\n",
      " And she has also undergone, a bypass graft or a CABG.\n",
      " In terms of her maternal family history, her mother has passed due to breast cancer and her father is alive, but is suffering from Alzheimer's.\n",
      " In terms of her social history, she reports no alcohol use, tobacco use active about a pack per day, and no illicit drug use.\n",
      " She's currently employed.\n",
      " Her diet is regular and balanced.\n",
      " She reports 1 cup per day in terms of caffeine.\n",
      " She exercises regularly prior to having these symptoms.\n",
      " Now she can no longer exercise.\n",
      " And, she lives with her husband.\n",
      " In terms of medications, she takes atorvastatin, clopidogrel, furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and warfarin.\n",
      " And let's see.\n",
      " In terms of drug allergies, she has no known drug allergies.\n",
      " When assessing her ROS, she does suffer from fatigue.\n",
      " She reports weight gain.\n",
      " There have been no skin, abnormalities.\n",
      " And when it comes to heat, there are also no abnormalities.\n",
      " And when assessing her chest, she reported no chest pain, no palpitations.\n",
      " They were all negative.\n",
      " When it comes to her lungs, she reports wheezing.\n",
      " Again, orthopnea as described in dyspnea.\n",
      " When it comes to muscular musculature, she does have lower extremity edema.\n",
      " And in terms of her neurological examination, there was nothing there it was all negative.\n",
      " Her vital signs were a temperature of 98.\n",
      "6, a heart rate of 90, rather high respiratory rate at 22, a low blood pressure, hypotension at 80 over 50, and her sp02 was also at 86, which was low.\n",
      " When assessing her neck, there was JVD present.\n",
      " And when assessing her her heart during the physical exam, we noticed, no murmur and her PMI was displaced and there was some tachycardia as well.\n",
      " When listening to her lung sounds, we found there was both wheezing and rales.\n",
      " In terms of her extremities, we found, pedal edema and decreased pulses.\n",
      " And in terms of imaging, she had cardiomegaly and palm pulmonary edema on the chest x-ray.\n",
      " When we assessed her two d echo, we found that there was a left ventricular ejection fracture of less than 30%.\n",
      " And in terms of imaging, when it came to the EKG, we found, normal sinus rhythm at 90.\n",
      " There was a left bundle branch block, and there was also, criteria that met left ventricular hypertrophy.\n",
      " Her troponin levels were elevated and her BNP was at 4,000.\n",
      " I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy based off of her lab values and her patient history.\n",
      " Her NYHA classification would put her at, a level of 4 where she cannot carry on physical activity due to her symptoms.\n",
      " And the plan that was, the plan would be to admit her to the ICU because her serious her condition is serious.\n",
      " This would necessitate checking her bottles every 2 hours as well as strict bed rest.\n",
      " And when it comes to the nurse, it requires, a strict intake and out outflow monitoring as well as a daily weight monitoring and also DVT prophylaxis in case her symptoms cause, a clot or an MOS.\n",
      " In terms of her diet, we would prefer her to be low sodium.\n",
      " In IV fluids, we should keep the vein open.\n",
      " In terms of medication, there is no necessity for pain meds.\n",
      " However, for cardiovascular, we should, prescribe clopidogrel, warfarin, and dobutamine.\n",
      " There's no need for diuretics at this moment.\n",
      " And because this is a diabetic patient, it would be best to put her on in the insulin sliding scale.\n",
      " And, again, based off of her oxygen saturation and her increased respiratory rate, I decided to put her on BiPAP.\n",
      " In terms of diagnostic lab orders, PT and INR because of the warfarin and serotroponins to see if there's any change in her, her heart status.\n",
      " And then there is no need for any new imaging at this at this point.\n",
      " However, in terms of consultations, I did recommend an interventional cardiologist.\n",
      " This would be for both in AICD placement as well as a CRTD placement, which could deliver a shock as needed.\n",
      " And that concludes my presentation.\n",
      ".\n",
      "So Leslie my patient is Leslie Palmer, who's a 62 year old female whose chief complaint is shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " The patient's shortness of breath, began about 2 months ago and has been getting worse.\n",
      " Patient describes feeling fluttering in her chest and, like, she's going to pass out.\n",
      " 3 days ago, the patient presented to her primary care physician where they ordered tests, and her primary care physician then recommended for her to go to the emergency room.\n",
      " Patient states that her symptoms get worse with activity and are better at rest.\n",
      " Patient is currently sleeping in a recliner at night because laying down makes her symptoms worse.\n",
      " On a scale of 0 to 10, patient describes the severity of her discomfort as a 7 or an 8.\n",

      " She also does not have any epigastric roots and no pulsatile masses.\n",
      " As far as her abnormal vitals go, she had a heart rate of a 110, a respiratory rate of 20, an oxygen saturation of 91%, and a blood pressure of 136 over 99.\n",
      " For her results of her lab and imaging, her lab work shows that she has an elevated PMP of 4,000.\n",
      " Her chest x-ray shows, cardiomegaly, mediastinal fullness, as well as pulmonary edema.\n",
      " Her echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55%.\n",
      " Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm and normal access, nonsustained ventricular, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.\n",
      " My leading differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association's, rate rating of 3.\n",
      " As far as the car cause goes, I explained the patient that most likely this is due to the pulmonary sarcoidosis that went to her heart and, resulted in arrhythmia and congestive heart failure.\n",
      " As far as assessment and plan goes, I am admitting the patient to tele telemetry.\n",
      " Sorry.\n",
      " Condition is serious.\n",
      " Allergies, none.\n",
      " Vitals, every 2 hours.\n",
      " She can be out of bed with assistance.\n",
      " As far as nursing interventions go, this would include strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, o two via nasal cannula, as well as maintaining oxygen saturation greater than 96%.\n",
      " A diet of low sodium is also recommended as well as for IV fluids, a saline lock, and keeping the vein open.\n",
      " As far as medications go, I recommend continuing lisinobel to lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily administering in deodorant a 150 milligram IV, increasing prednisone to 60 milligrams once daily, and, adding furosemide 40 milligram IV.\n",

      " He denies any alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug re the use, and just has him on a cup of coffee.\n",
      " His review of symptoms was positive for wheezing.\n",
      " Also, obviously, palpitations, presyncope, and it was, negative for any lower extremity edema or chest pain, any in the musculoskeletal.\n",
      " The neurological severe symptoms are unremarkable.\n",
      " His, his vitals, showed a blood pressure of 130 over 90, oxygen saturation at 96%, heart rate at 110, respiratory rate was 16, and, temperature was 98.\n",
      "6.\n",
      " Physical exam revealed, no JVD, no carotid or, no carotid or abdominal bruise.\n",
      " There was a positive systolic murmur in s 4 as well as a gallop.\n",
      " No friction rub.\n",

      " Yeah, x-ray chest x-ray, build cardiomegaly, BMP, and troponin labs were, normal and remarkable.\n",
      " 2 d echo showed, left ventricular hypertrophy, usual atrial enlargement.\n",
      " The sorry.\n",
      " The EKG revealed, left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria as well as tall r waves in the septal leads, suggestive of interventricular septal hypertrophy and left ventricular hypertrophy.\n",

      " I'd recommend it to be admitted to the hospital to telemetry.\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      " So it's condition serious, get vitals every 2 hours, strict ISO strict IO, daily weight, nasal cannula, oxygen delivery to maintain oxygen saturation 96%.\n",
      " That can be normal activity as tolerated.\n",
      " This discontinues Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and replace it with disopyrimide a 100 milligrams 4 times a day.\n",
      " We'll do IV lock, saline lock, keep the veins open, and no labs or other imaging is warranted at this point due to our consult to the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible septomyomectomy as well or, alcohol injection to reduce the obstructive of of the outflow tract obstruction in the outflow tract, or, and also to the interventional cardiologist to, for a possible AICD placement.\n",
      " With that with that one moment, I think, yeah, miss Palms, ready to see you.\n",

      "Reported to the ED this morning.\n",
      " She's a 62 year old female with a cheek complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and dull chest pain.\n",
      " She presented to her family medicine physician 3 days ago to be evaluated.\n",
      " She says she had a cold 2 weeks ago consisting of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and fatigue.\n",
      " The symptoms went away 5 days ago but returned, and now she feels worse than before.\n",
      " She continued to go to the gym while she was sick but stopped when her symptoms came back.\n",
      " She noticed that she sleeps in a chair at night because it helps her breathe better.\n",
      " She knows she is comfortable at rest, but has dys dyspnea on exertion and with some exercise and orthopnea.\n",
      " This places her at a New York Heart Association classification of class 2.\n",
      " Her past medical history includes hypertension when she takes Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily for.\n",
      " She has no known drug allergies.\n",
      " Her past surgical history includes cardiac catheter 1 year ago that showed no abnormalities.\n",
      " Her mother passed away 5 years ago due to, breast cancer, and her father is currently living with Alzheimer's.\n",
      " She eats a healthy and well balanced diet.\n",
      " And before the symptoms started, she exercised 2 to 3 times a week.\n",
      " She denies any illicit drug abuse, alcohol, and any illicit drug use, use of tobacco products, and, consumption of alcohol.\n",
      " She drinks 1 cup of coffee daily.\n",
      " And she's a 3rd grade teacher, and she's not being updated on her immunizations and having insurance.\n",
      " Her review of symptoms is positive for fatigue, weight gain of £8 over the past 2 weeks, chest palpitations, dull ache and chest pain, wheezing, myalgia, and lower extremity edema.\n",
      " Her physical exams revealed JVD, bibasal rails, PMI displays laterally, one plus pinning edema in her lower extremities and normal radial gersalaspidus and posterior toenial pulses.\n",
      " Her lab demonstrated elevated troponin at point 10 and BNP at 4,000.\n",
      " Her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.\n",
      " Her echo demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%.\n",
      " Her EKG indicated sinus tachycardia, right bundle branch block, left axis deviation, and preventricular contractions.\n",
      " Her vitals showed temperature of 98.\n",
      "6, elevated heart rate of 110, elevated respiratory rate of 20, elevated blood pressure of 130 over 90, and her o two was slightly decreased at 91%.\n",
      " So based on her history, exam findings, and the diagnostic workouts, I believe that miss Palmer has a myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association, class 2, which is serious condition.\n",
      " I think the best point of action would be to admit her to telemetry to monitor her vitals every 2 hours.\n",
      " She can proceed with activity as tolerated, and she'd be monitored by nursing for shift IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, o two nasal cannula to 19 o two stats greater than 96%, and her saline fluid should be KBO, and her diet should be low sodium and food rejection.\n",
      " A 2 day I believe a 2 day echo should be repeated.\n",
      " She should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and begin, or she should continue her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and begin furosemide 40 milligrams IV over 12 hours and acetaminophen 625 milligrams every 6 hours.\n",
      " ACMP and serial troponin should be ordered.\n",
      " A consult with interventional cardiology, infectious disease, and radiology should be conducted to place an I aICD and CRTD, And an endomyocardial biopsy should also be completed.\n",
      " A media enhanced MRI should be completed, and her immuno immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids should be evaluated.\n",
      " And that is the end of my case presentation.\n",

      "Missus Culmer is a 62 year old woman who presented to the emergency department today with shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " She was in her normal state of good health until about 2 weeks ago when she developed a cough, chest pain, rhinorrhea, and fever, which she described as a cold.\n",
      " 5 days ago, she noticed that while all of her other symptoms had resolved, her chest pain fatigue and shortness of breath had actually gotten worse.\n",
      " So 3 days ago, she saw her family medicine top doctor who recommended today that she come to the emergency department as the chest pain has continued to worsen.\n",
      " She has hypertension for which she's been taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams for 10 years, and a cardiac catheter 1 year ago following an abnormal EKG showed no coronary artery disease.\n",

      " A chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.\n",
      " A two d echo showed ventricular dilation with an ejection fraction of less than 30, and an EKG showed a right bundle branch block and a sinus tachycardia.\n",
      " My leading differential diagnosis is myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy in the New York Health Association class 2, Heart Association class 2.\n",

      " So mister Palmer presented with, complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue that had been ongoing for the past 6 months.\n",
      " He said that this was kind of just mild for 6 months, and then over the last 3 days, it started progressively worsening.\n",
      " So he went to his primary care physician who ordered a few tests, which he was not sure of the name of.\n",
      " However, when his symptoms significantly worsened today, he called his PCP again who referred him to the emergency department.\n",
      " Patient stated that his shortness of breath is worse with lying flat, and with any type of exertion at all, such as just walking around.\n",
      " And he feels a little bit better when he lays back on an incline.\n",
      " When I walked in the room, his vitals showed a blood pressure of 80 over 50 with an SpO 2 of 86 and a heart rate of, 90 beats per minute.\n",
      " His past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease with a coronary bar coronary artery bypass graft times 3 12 years ago with an additional stent placed, more recently.\n",

      " His most recent echo that he had done with us showed an injection fraction of 30% and a dilated left ventricle.\n",
      " Given this, I diagnosed mister Palmer with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with plan to admit him to the ICU, reorder his PTINR and seropetrol troponins, and I kept him on clopidogrel, warfarin, lisinopril, and started him on dobutamine as a positive ionotropic agent.\n",
      " I also told him that the interventional cardiologist would be coming by to consult and, discuss AICD CRT placement to also assist with increasing the heart's pumping power, and to consider that as a potential medical device.\n",

      " She states that her current symptoms are better when she is in her recliner.\n",
      " So she's been sleeping in her recliner, at night to help with these symptoms.\n",
      " When she lays flat, her symptoms are worse, and, her symptoms also worsen with, some daily activities, which would put her at an NYHA classification of class 2.\n",
      " Her other pertinent medical history includes a 10 year history of hypertension, which is well managed on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams by mouth daily.\n",
      " She has no allergies to medications and no history of illicit drug use, no history of alcohol use, and no history of tobacco use.\n",

      " She currently is sleeping in a recliner, at night to alleviate her symptoms.\n",
      " She presented with fatigue, an 8 pound weight gain in 2 weeks.\n",
      " She has presyncope, as well as palpitations, and some wheezing was noted.\n",
      " Entering into the room, her vitals, were a little, a little out of the ordinary range, but not too bad.\n",
      " Her heart rate was 110.\n",
      " Respiration rate was, 20.\n",
      " Her blood was 136 over 99, and her o two sat was 91%.\n",
      " So she presented with a history of a heart catheterization a year ago.\n",
      " She has hypertension and has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis for, about 25 years.\n",

      " So as I was, going through my physical exam, there are a few pertinent details.\n",
      " She was positive for JVD, but she didn't have any carotid brewery.\n",
      " Her heart rate was regular, but there was an s 4 murmur that was noted.\n",
      " There was no regurge.\n",
      " The PMI was normal placement, and there was no tenderness on the chest wall.\n",
      " Doing a pulmonary exam, there were bilateral raws, and wheezing noted.\n",
      " And there was 1 plus pitting edema, in her lower extremities, but, the pulse was equal and calves were nontender, and there was a negative Homan sign.\n",
      " For her labs, BNP was at 4,000, and there was restricted, cardiomyopathy with a 55% ingestion fraction noted on the echo that was ordered on admission.\n",
      " For EKG, there was normal rhythm.\n",
      " So it's normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, but, there was a non sustained ventricular tachycardia noted in leads, v 1 through 3.\n",
      " So following, her admission into the hospital, I'd like to admit her for, for telemetry, followed up every 2 hours.\n",
      " I'd like to place her on a low sodium diet, with a saline lock as well so we have IV access.\n",
      " I'd like to cons continue her Lisinopril, but add, a 150, IV of amiodarone and increase her, her prednisone, to 60 milligrams, as well as per on furosemide, 40 milligrams IV.\n",
      " And I I'd like to have her on a nasal cannula, with the o two sat greater than 96, doing that with 2 liters of oxygen per minute.\n",
      " Once she's all set up, with telemetry, then I'd like to get a CMP on her and then refer out to interventional cardiology for an AICD placement as well as radiology for an FDG, PET scan.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Missus Palmer is a 62 year old female that presented today, Pleasant, awake, alert oriented, little bit fatigued, mildly in pain, and with a mildly elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.\n",

      " Patient was positive for, jugular venous distension.\n",
      " Patient had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur, and and there was signs of gallops.\n",
      " The PMI was nondisplaced.\n",
      " I heard, bibasilar rallies.\n",
      " There was wheezing.\n",
      " I confirmed the pitting edema in the lower extremities.\n",
      " Then I looked at the diagnostic findings.\n",
      " Troponin levels were within normal limits, same with everything else except for the BNP.\n",
      " That was, at 4,000, so that was elevated.\n",
      " Chest x-ray, when I looked at it, it just showed some lymphedema lymphadenopathy.\n",
      " Looking at the two d echo, the ventricle, the chambers were non dilated.\n",
      " There was some evidence of some left ventricular hypertrophy.\n",
      " Oh, I meant no left ventricular hypertrophy, but the walls were rigid.\n",
      " I apologize for that.\n",
      " The EKG findings showed, normal sinus rhythm and normal axis, and non sustained left ventricular tachycardia.\n",
      " So that led me to believe that she had, sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " And so because of that, I admitted her to the hospital, so that we can, monitor her.\n",
      " We wanna get vitals every 2 hours.\n",
      " I said, strict ins and outs, check the daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, because of the 91% oxygen saturation.\n",

      " And a few episodes of near syncope, which she's described as not fully passing out but getting close to it, and lightheadedness as well.\n",
      " She has a past medical history, as I said, of hypertension sarcoidosis, and she said she recently had a cardiac catheterization a few years ago because of an concerning EKG, which came back normal.\n",
      " She has a past family history.\n",
      " It's concerning for her mother who suddenly died at the age of 40, and her father died at 59 years old of a heart attack.\n",
      " She's currently taking Lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day, and prednisone, 20 milligrams, 20 milligrams once a day.\n",
      " She has no known drug allergies.\n",
      " She lives a pretty healthy lifestyle.\n",

      " She currently works as an elementary school teacher, and, she's married to her husband who she lives with.\n",
      " I mentioned all of her pertinent review systems.\n",
      " Everything else was negative.\n",
      " As for her vital signs, she was tachycardic to 110.\n",
      " She was, not hypoxic, but she was borderline with an SPO 2 of 91%.\n",
      " Had a respiration rate of 20 mgsnerticipnik, and then she was mildly hypertensive at 136 over 99, and afebrile.\n",

      " I think the plan should be to continue her on lisinopril, but add amiodarone as well as, adding Lasix for volume overload in her lower extremities, as well as, I think we should increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams per day instead of the 20 milligrams per day.\n",

      " Because of that, I told him that I would like to admit him into the hospital, and keep him on a monitor.\n",
      " I recommended that we discontinue his Lisinopril and started him on desupuramide a 100 milligrams instead.\n",
      " That way we can monitor for any, arrhythmias or any kind of problems in case that happens.\n",

      " My patient today is, was a 62, I believe, year old male.\n",
      " And, he came in complaining of tiredness and shortness of breath.\n",
      " And the first time he had, felt these symptoms was about 2 weeks before while on a walk with friends and regular exercise, and these walks with friends is, a normal part of his lifestyle.\n",
      " And, so he experienced that shortness of breath and tiredness precipitated by that walking exercise.\n",
      " And it continued to worsen every time he exercise, every time he went on a walk.\n",

      " Everything came back negative, so he referred, the patient to us at the ER.\n",

      " But, no, beyond that, healthy, he's on Lisinopril 10 milligrams for that hypertension.\n",
      " So when I went over my physical exam, generally, I I when listening to his heart and lungs, several things came up.\n",
      " Mainly that being the palpitations, there was a murmur present.\n",
      " There was also a displaced point of max maximal impulse laterally, and I heard that wheezing, when listening to the lungs.\n",

      " No.\n",
      " I didn't order any diagnostics or imaging, but I did refer him to interventional cardiology for AICD placement.\n",
      " And I also referred him to cardi cardiothoracic surgery for a possible, future septal myomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce that, left ventricular obstruction.\n",

      " They need to keep their vein open, so KBO.\n",
      " In terms of medications, which of all the ones that they were on, they need to stop them, except for the clopidogrel 75 milligrams and warfarin 2.\n",
      "5, 2 times daily because we do not want to throw a clot.\n",
      " We are also going to add dobutamine IV drip and an insulin sliding scale due to diabetes.\n",
      " Dobutamine will be used to allow for better contraction of the heart since there was that pulmonary edema.\n",
      " See.\n",
      " So in terms of labs that need to be found or keep taken, we need to get serial troponins taking taken, to see if that heart tissue is breaking down more.\n",

      ".\n",
      "And I am presenting to you today the case that I saw in the emergency room.\n",
      " I saw a 62 year old female.\n",
      " She she came in with the chief complaint of shortness and breath and fatigue.\n",
      " She reports that this the onset of this occurred around 2 weeks ago, which she reported to her family medicine practice.\n",
      " They advised that she come in to be examined.\n",
      " She did report that, she is experiencing dyspnea and, paroxysmal orthopnea, which, her dyspnea is worsened by, strenuous activity or being active, whereas her orthopnea is worsened by laying down.\n",
      " Rest relieves her dyspnea and her, her orthopnea is relieved where she has to prop herself up on pillows especially when she's sleeping.\n",
      " She also reports that during exertion she does feel presyncable episodes, coming on and as well as she has, she's significant for palpitations.\n",
      " The patient was alert alert and coherent.\n",
      " However, she was fatigued and, pretty concerned about her current condition.\n",
      " Our review of systems yielded, she was negative for chest pain.\n",
      " She again was positive for palpitations and syncope.\n",
      " She denied wheezing or coughing, just dyspnea and orthopnea was positive.\n",
      " Her she did report that she did experience, edema, impending edema specifically, and her past medical history is significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams for, and she is also significant for hypertension, which she takes 10 milligrams of Lisinopril for.\n",
      " She does report that she is consistent with her medication and she uses it as prescribed.\n",
      " Her mother is also, her family has revealed that her mother did die suddenly of an unexplained cause at 40 years old, and then her father did die at 59 years old from, from a ischemic cardiac event.\n",
      " She does report that she has no non drug allergies.\n",
      " Upon physical exam, it yielded that she was tachycardic, she had a heart rate of 110, her o2 or her pulse ox was 91%, her respiration was 20 beats per minute, she was mildly hypertensive, she was 130 over 90, and you know continuing with the physical exam, she, pulses were intact bilateral, there was no there were no Baruis present, and auscultation did yield a cardiac murmur, and there was bilateral rails, as well as pitting edema present.\n",
      " Chest x-ray did, you know, reviewing the chest x-ray, it did reveal pulmonary edema as well as mediastinal mediastinal fullness and pulmonary infiltrates, which were detected, which were positive for a Paulinberger sign.\n",
      " Her echocardiogram did yield that there was, thickening, and there was a preserved ejection fraction, of the heart, and her EKG did demonstrate that there was, non sustained ventricular tachycardia.\n",
      " So regarding her labs, her BMP was also significantly elevated to 4,000.\n",
      " And this was discussed with the patient as far as the clinical findings are concerned, so, given this information I would say her, she also reports that she is a non smoker, non drinker, she's fairly active which is how she noticed that something was going on.\n",
      " So regarding this information, I do believe that she is suffering from sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy, and I would classify her as a New York Heart Association Class 3.\n",
      " She has a secondary diagnosis of hypertension as well as pulmonary edema, and my plan for this patient is to admit to telemetry.\n",
      " I want to consult with interventional cardiology as well as radiology, so we can go ahead and see if there may be a need for a pacemaker or we could also get a fed pet.\n",
      " Additionally, as far as orders are concerned, she could be activity as monitored activity or support.\n",
      " She's going to be on nasal cannula, and I like to start DVT prophylaxis as well as strict IO and daily weights.\n",
      " Additionally, I would like to continue clisinopril.\n",
      " However, I would like to increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams.\n",
      " And then I would also like to start her on, amiodarone 150 so it can improve her cardiac output.\n",
      " And also for referred, SVT.\n",
      " And as far as lifestyle modifications are concerned, you know, as long as she maintains healthy weight, diet, and weight reduction, she may be able to, you know when she meets with, intervention interventional cardiology and nuclear medicine, she may be able to, you know have a better, or an improved outcome.\n",
      " Thank you so much, and I look, I look, forward to just asking this case with you.\n",
      " Bye.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      " Good afternoon.\n",
      " So we have a 60 year old woman who's presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " The patient has experienced flu like symptoms days prior to arrival.\n",
      " She states that her breathing is labored and sleeps in her recliner to alleviate the symptoms of shortness of breath.\n",
      " Her activity level has drastically decreased and her symptoms improve upon rest.\n",
      " She had a fever, cough, and runny nose which has since subsided days prior.\n",
      " Patient also has chest pain, slight palpitations, dyspnea, and orthopnea.\n",
      " Patient denies syncope and abnormal skin rashes or lesions.\n",
      " On further review of symptoms, patient does complain of wheezing and swelling in her lower legs.\n",
      " The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension in which she is currently taking Lisinopril 10 milligrams by mouth daily, and the patient denies consuming alcohol, using illicit drugs, and smoking any tobacco products.\n",
      " Her vital signs that were within normal limits included the blood pressure, which was 130 over 90, and her temperature, which was 98.\n",
      "6 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      " Her elevated vital signs included the heart rate, which was 110, and respiratory rate, which was 20.\n",
      " Her oxygen saturation level was decreased.\n",
      " It read 91%.\n",
      " And on physical exam, pinning edema was shown in her lower extremities and also rails and wheezing were noted during lung auscultation.\n",
      " Hypertension, actually primary assessment is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to previous viral infection.\n",
      " However, hypertension could be provided as a secondary assessment and the plan to treat these symptoms would be to admit the patient to telemetry units just for monitoring and we also want to begin nursing to have her on a strict IO to do daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and to place the, patient on the o two nasal cannula to increase the oxygen saturation to 96%.\n",
      " And, also, we wanna give her medications with Lisinopril, acetaminophen, and furosemide.\n",
      " Wanna do 10 milligrams by mouth of Lisinopril, 625 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours of acetaminophen, and 40 milligrams of furosemide IV.\n",
      " And because she's on furosemide, we wanna make sure we order a CNP because her troponin levels were also high and her BNP was also high.\n",
      " We wanna make sure we order troponin levels to be monitored and to do a repeat echocardiogram.\n",
      " That's her chest x-ray and her echo showed her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly and the echo showed the left ventricular ejection fraction weight was below 30%, and we also want to have interventional cardiology follow her as well as infectious disease and radiology.\n",
      " She's gonna get a, contrast enhanced MRI of her heart as well as, be put on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids because of the infection, and we would like to, look at a endomyocardial biopsy as well as CRTD and AICD, which are just the pacemaker and defibrillation, and we will have the patient continue to be monitored and checked every 2 hours while on the floor.\n",
      " Thank you.\n",

      " And currently, she's experiencing chest pain.\n",
      " As of now, she does not have a fever, but she does have shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " When I asked her what aggravates, the shortness of breath, she says that any daily activities like walking around really makes her feel the shortness of breath and fatigue, but sitting in a reclined seat, so, like, sitting in her recliner, alleviates her symptoms.\n",
      " She also describes the chest pain as just dull chest pain.\n",

      " And her living situation is that she lives currently with her husband, and she is a school teacher for her occupation.\n",
      " Now when going through, the review systems, for general general review system, everything was negative except for, an 8 pound weight gain within the last 2 weeks.\n",
      " All skin, review systems were negative.\n",
      " All HINTS review systems were negative.\n",
      " Neuro, everything was negative.\n",

      " So I reviewed the labs with the patient.\n",
      " I reviewed the chest x-ray with the patient.\n",
      " I reviewed her EKG as well as her echo and her echo digital dilated left ventricular wall dilation with decreased effusion rate, which is around 30%.\n",
      " So I explained all her labs to her.\n",
      " I went over the lab, chest x-ray, EKG, and then we went with the plan.\n",
      " And so I told her considering that she did have a viral infection in the past few days and all her signs pointed to dilated cardiomyopathy, I do believe this is myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " So her symptoms were due to her previous viral infection.\n",
      " So due to that, I'm going to place her furosemide to be able to get rid of the edema she has in her legs and in, her lungs.\n",
      " I also wanna continue her listen to proof of her blood pressure.\n",
      " I'm gonna give her acetaminophen for her chest pain.\n",
      " Labs wise, I'm gonna repeat troponin to be able to see, if it improves, and we're gonna repeat an ETG excuse me, repeat an echo.\n",
      " I also recommended that we add a cardiologist, an intervention interventional cardiologist to the team to be able to see if she's a candidate for, a defibrillator and add a radiologist to the team and infectious disease specialist.\n",
      " So with all that, I do believe the patient does have, hopeful outcomes, and I explained all this to her.\n",
      " She said that she had she was on board with the plan.\n",
      " She had social support at home, and that she did have insurance to be able to cover the cost of all this.\n",
      " I also told her that we would be admitting her to the telemetry floor and not the ICU.\n",
      " So admit to the telemetry floor.\n",
      " And then I also, lastly, explained to her that myocarditis was probably due to the viral infection shift before.\n",
      " The patient stated that she understood everything.\n",
      " She did not have any questions at the moment and agreed with her plan.\n",

      " The EKG showed sinus tach, which was consistent with the monitor we had on her, and a right bundle branch block.\n",
      " So based on the physical exam history and lab work, I diagnosed myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " So we are admitting her to the hospital with telemetry, serious condition, so we are gonna check vitals every 2 hours.\n",
      " Activity, I left as tolerated.\n",
      " For nursing interventions, strict input output, maintaining daily weight and DVT prophylaxis, and putting a nasal cannula on to maintain her oxygen sats above 96.\n",
      " For IV fluids, we're gonna, add furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to help with the pulmonary edema.\n",
      " And so I left IV fluid status as keep veins open.\n",

      " Her two d echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricle ejection fraction fraction of less than 30%, while her EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block and left axis with premature ventricular contractions.\n",
      " I also advised that her lab values of troponin and BNP were elevated with BNP being at 4,000.\n",
      " I would place I would place the patient as a New York Heart Association functional classification of 2 with a slight limitation of physical activity while also admitting the patient to telemetry since her condition is serious.\n",
      " And basic consults with the interventional cardiologist to consult for an AICD CRTD placement, and endocardial biopsy with infectious disease, consult to for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoid therapy and a radiologist consult for media enhanced cardiac MRI.\n",
      " Nursing interventions include for the strict intake of strict intake and output of nursing dimension include a monitoring of strict intake and output, monitoring of daily weight and DVT prophylaxis while also maintaining an oxygen saturation above 96% with nasal cannula with 2 liters per minute.\n",
      " Her activity levels can be tolerated while having a slow low sodium diet with IV fluids to keep her veins open.\n",
      " I would also like to start with celestion furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 2 12 hours and acetaminophen 6 125 milligrams by orally every 6 hours, every 6 hours while continuing Lisinoprilen 10 milligrams daily.\n",
      " The furosemide would be to remove some of the fluid, to reduce the congestion on her heart.\n",
      " Acetaminophen would be for her chest pain, her chest discomfort, and lisinopril would be for her high, hypertension.\n",
      " I would also like to repeat labs, including CMP and serotroponin, given that we are to monitor her cardiac health and electrolyte levels given that we are start would should be starting furosemide as well as a BP two d echo to valid to further evaluate her to further evaluate her heart health.\n",
      ".\n",
      "So I just met with Leslie Palmer.\n",
      " She is a 62 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation.\n",
      " She presents to the emergency department for the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " This patient states that approximately 6 months ago, she started experiencing these symptoms, even while she is at rest.\n",
      " She admits to dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and wheezing.\n",
      " She also states that she's gained £8 within the past 2 weeks and that she noticed that her lower extremities are swollen.\n",
      " She denies chest pain or any palpitations.\n",
      " 3 days ago, she saw her PCP who did labs on her and called her today and referred her to the emergency department, which is why she's here.\n",
      " She also states that she's been smoking 1 pack per day for the past 30 years, And then she also told me about her surgical history.\n",
      " So 12 years ago, she had bypass surgery.\n",
      " And then within the past 5 years, she's also had 5 stents.\n",
      " Her most recent stent was placed 1 year ago at her left anterior descending coronary artery, and her most recent echo, which was also 1 year ago, indicated that her left ventricular ejection fractional was at 40%.\n",
      " When I looked at her vitals, and even when walking into the room, she clearly looked to Kipnick.\n",
      " She showed that there was she had 22 breaths per minute, and she was also hypotensive at 80 over 50.\n",
      " Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air.\n",
      " So on physical exam, the patient was leaning over and gasping for breath.\n",
      " I saw, when I was auscultating her 4 posts, I saw that she was tachycardic with a split s 2, but I did not hear any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\n",
      " When I was auscultating her lungs, I heard bibasilar reals.\n",
      " And then when I was assessing her lower extremity, I saw 1 plus pinning edema bilaterally, but her pulses were normal and equal bilaterally.\n",
      " When I was looking at her labs, she had elevated troponin and BNP.\n",
      " Her troponin was 0.\n",
      "04 while her BNP was at 4,000.\n",
      " Her test x-ray indicated that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, and her echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.\n",
      " So it that is a 10% decrease, from last year's echo.\n",
      " When I was looking at her EKG, the most prominent finding was that she had a left bundle branch block, indicative of that s two split.\n",
      " And she had a normal sinus for them, and her her heart did have a left axis deviation, the left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria.\n",
      " So based on her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, that's been worsening over the past 6 months, based off her physical exam and all of her imaging, I would say that she has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " She's class 4 for the New York, standards of classification.\n",
      " Again, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.\n",
      " So I will admit her.\n",
      " I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU.\n",
      " I have consulted interventional cardiologist, for possible automatic implantable cardiomerder defibrillator and or a cardiac resynchronization therapy, at this time.\n",
      " And thank you so much for listening to my presentation.\n",
      ".\n",
      "Palmer.\n",
      " Patient presents with, shortness of breath and fatigue.\n",
      " Patient states that the symptoms began a couple weeks ago and has progressively became worse over the last 2 to 3 days.\n",
      " Symptoms are exacerbated, with some exercise and only relieved by rest patient.\n",
      " Has not tried any, patient has not tried any other treatments besides rest and is helpful when he, like, lays down.\n",
      " Medication he's currently taking he's currently taking, clobasopril 10 milligrams.\n",
      " He is taking this for his diagnosis of hypertension.\n",
      " He is currently up to date on autoimmuneizations, and only hospitalization, was a cardiac cath, which was, which turned out to be normal about a year ago.\n",
      " Family medical history was normal on his mother's side and on his father's side.\n",
      " He his father had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 59, myocardial infarction.\n",
      " Diet is balanced.\n",
      " Patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily.\n",
      " Caffeine intake was 1 cup a day.\n",
      " He is employed as a 5th grade allergen school teacher where he does have insurance through them.\n",
      " He is sexually active with his wife.\n",
      " When going over the review systems, patient has presented with, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, and dyspnea.\n",
      " I went ahead and then performed the physical exam.\n",
      " Physical exam and findings included, no jugular venous distension.\n",
      " He had a crescendo, decrescendo systolic murmur and with s 4.\n",
      " The PMI was laterally displaced.\n",
      " Patient presented with no edema in the lower extremities, and impulses were normal bilaterally, And lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally.\n",
      " When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at 0, which is normal.\n",
      " BNP was at 90, which is normal.\n",
      " X-ray showed cardiomegaly.\n",
      " It did not show pulmonary infiltrates.\n",
      " Echo showed a left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%.\n",
      " EKG showed tall septal r waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was a sinus rhythm.\n",
      " It was tachycardic.\n",
      " Patient did have a pulse of a 110 beats per minute.\n",
      " Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic.\n",
      " Oxygen saturation, in the room was 96%.\n",
      " Respiratory rate was at 16 breaths per minute, and temperature, 98.\n",
      "6 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      " Based on the, diagnostic labs that were ordered labs and tests that were ordered, his physical exam, and past medical history.\n",
      " I believe this patient had has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " I do suggest that we admit this patient to, telemetry, and we stop the Lisinopril, start him on a 100 milligrams of Dasopyramide, every day by IV.\n",
      " I also believe that we should refer the mister Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we where we possibly can implant, an AICD placement.\n",
      " I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery, for alcohol injections and septomyectomy to, reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\n",
