Student 001,.mp3,Student 001.mp3,"Ms. Palmer is a 62-year-old female presenting to the ER with chest palpitations and syncope. The symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past two months and have increased dramatically over the past three days. They happen during any activity. The patient presented with an eight-pound weight gain, swollen legs, syncope, palpitations, coughing, and is currently sleeping in a chair. Her previous medical problems are hypertension-controlled and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Her current medications are prednisone and lisinopril with no known drug allergies. She does not use tobacco, illicit drugs, or alcohol. She walks on a daily basis, drink drinks one cup of coffee per day, and is an elementary school teacher. Her mother died from a from sudden death at age 40 and father from a myocardial infarction at 59. Her physical exam showed jugular venous distention, wheezing, an S4 murmur, lower extremity edema. Labs and imaging support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis that has infiltrated the heart muscle. Our plan is to admit to the hospital where she will follow up with a cardiologist and radiologist for a PET scan. We will up her dose of prednisone to 60 mg, add furosemide and amiodarone. She will continue on her current lisinopril. Thank you.",,
Student 002,.mp3,Student 002.mp3,"Hi Dr. Rawlins, I just saw Ms. Palmer in room 6 and she is a 62 year old female who presents to the emergency department with a 2 month history of worsening dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and near syncope. She stated that her symptoms improved with rest um however they were brought on by most activity including her daily tasks. She denies any chest pain but also reported that um some orthopnea causing her to sleep in her chair at night. She stated that she was seen in a family practice office 3 days ago where they did a 2D echo, EKG, labs, and a chest x-ray . She stated that she was instructed by her family practitioner to come to the ER due to her worsening symptoms. Her active medical conditions include hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams once daily. She reported that both medical conditions have been well controlled with her medications. She denied any allergies and reported that she had a cardiac cath about a year ago due to an abnormal EKG but there was no coronary occlusion. She denied any prior hospitalizations and reported that she is fully immunized. She reports that her mom died suddenly at the age of 40 and her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 59. She stated she has a good support system and lives at home with her spouse. And she stated she is sexually active with her spouse and that the relationship is monogamous. She stated she has a balanced diet and used to walk daily with friends until her recent symptoms um have prevented her from continuing to do so. She denies any tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. And reported that she drinks about 1 cup of coffee in the morning and works as a 3rd grade school teacher. My physical exam showed bibasilar rales and wheezing on lung auscultation, heart sounds were regular with a systolic murmur and S4 heart sound and no carotid bruits. Her PMI was normal but she had JVD bilaterally and um I noted some pedal edema. Her lower extremity pulses were normal and her calves were of equal size and color and nontender to palpation and she had a negative Homan's sign. Her chest was nontender to palpation I also evaluated anterior Chapmans points, posterior TART changes, and her um thoracic spine and I had no osteopathic findings to report. Her chest Xray uh demonstrated mediastinal fullness with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and um a normal heart size. Her Echo showed a restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and her labs revealed a normal troponin but an elevated BNP at 4000. Based on my findings I believe she has sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy NYHA class 3 and I explained that I believe the pulmonary sarcoidosis has begun to infiltrate her heart as well. I recommended that we admit her to the telemetry unit and consider consult with interventional cardiology for the placement of an AICD and consult with cardiology for a possible FDG-PET scan. I also recommended that we keep her on the lisinopril um increase her prednisone dose to 60 milligrams daily, um add furosemide 40 milligrams IV and also um an amiodarone drip of 150 milligrams um and that is all thank you. ",,
Student 003,.mp3,Student 003.mp3,"Presented um today with shortness of breath and um fatigue. She is 62 years old and presented to the emergency room. She said rest makes her pain or her shortness of breath better um and also sitting up in her chair and exercise makes it significantly worse. So Ms. Palmer is a female and um her past medical history consists of diabetes, hypertension as well as hyperlipidemia. Um she's been experiencing these symptoms for about 6 months and went to her PCP about 3 days ago they sent her to us and now here she is. So her um medical history also includes diabetes not sure if I mentioned that. Um and I have my um notes in front of me. The patient has a history of a um bypass surgery um and got about 5 stents beginning placed the first one was placed 20 years ago the most recent one was placed a year ago and she was told she can no long receive that sort of treatment. Excuse me. She appeared well, um alert, however slightly fatigue and she didn't have any skin lacerations, or bruising um just fatigue shortness of breath were her chief complaints. She had no neurological signs. Her heart was beating fast she said some syncope and uh dyspnea and um better with lying down so um orthopnea and she had wheezing and rales when she came in. So the physical exam showed that she had jugular venous distention, as well as the wheezing the wheezing and the rales um she also had pedal edema and um even pulses. She said her mother had breast cancer and her father had Alzheimer's. She um is on a handful of medications. She’s on amiodarone, warfarin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, metoprolol-succinate. And um have had the history of the surgical procedure so the shunt. She has no allergies. Um and after all the diagnosis was done or all the um the physical exam was done uh we talked about our results together. Um I presented her EKG which showed a left bundle branch block so left ventricular hypertrophy but normal sinus rhythm. Her uh echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy and her xray showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema as well as her labs showed elevated troponin of 4 and her BNP of 4000. Um after this I uh originally had the differential of potential heart failure um maybe some musculoskeletal chest pain because she was in the best health to begin with. And um ischemic cardiomyopathy ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and that is what it ended up being. Um so she was advised um to be admitted to the ICU and talk to an interventional cardiology who would get her set up with an AICD and a and um not place another stent but place another cardiac device. So she was being admitted on a low sodium diet with um absolutely full restriction to exercise. Um her nursing orders were strict IO, um daily weights taken, and DVT prophylaxis. Yeah moving ahead she’ll see all the specialists be in the hospital until she's feeling better um and we did shift her medications so she's only taking clopidogrel and warfarin and dobutamine now um and she was put on an insulin sliding scale when she was admitted because of her diabetes as well as given a bipap machine to help with her shortness of breath. The patient also has history of atrial fibrillation. The patient was um asked if they had medical insurance and they did they have pharmacy set up and they have a supportive home so they are in a good place moving forward and I'm hopeful that um they will be able to receive the care that they need and continue on their journey to find health.  ",4:57 couldn’t fully understand this sentence “So she was being admitted on a low sodium diet with um absolutely full restriction to exercise” ,

Patient also reports instances of feeling like he would pass out. He says that he is not short of breath at rest but that even with walking short distances he is short of breath. Um I think I would give him an NYHA score of class 3. He is able to lay flat and denies any recent illness. He has a history of hypertension and is on lisinopril.

Uh PT and DP pulses were full and equal bilaterally. Uh labs showed a troponin and BNP within normal limits. EKG showed left ventricular left ventricular hypertrophy and tall septal R waves. Echo showed thickened interventricular septum with an EF of 60%. Um patient should be admitted to telemetry due to diagnosis of hypertrophic cardio familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Uh secondary diagnosis would be hypertension. Um I advised the patient that we should discontinue lisinopril and start on disopyramide. Consult was done with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgeon for either alcohol ablation or  myectomy. Patient is in agreement with plan he was counseled on um the further plan and he was alerted of the cause of his symptoms. Thank you. ",,

Student 006,.mp3,Student 006.mp3,"Patient I am reviewing today is a 65 year old male named Leslie Palmer. He presented with shortness of breath and fatigue when exercising um he mentioned he had several episodes of near syncope. He went to his family medicine doctor where they ran multiple tests and he was recommended to come to the ER if he kept having these symptoms. He uh again had shortness of breath, near syncope. He was breathless and fatigued when he tried to exercise and his heart was beating out of his chest. When going over his past medical history he had hypertension which he was on 10 milligrams of lisinopril for um he had a cardiac cath a year ago eh due to an abnormal EKG. When discussing his family history he mentioned his mother died suddenly at 40 years old and his father was deceased at 59 from a myocardial infarction.

Uh no rashes, no bruises, no lesions on the skin. Um HEENT findings were negative. So no headache, no stiffness of the neck, no visual or uh um auditory difficulties. Um for cardiovascular he did have those palpitations and near syncope but no chest pain. Um he complained of wheezing and dyspnea but orthopnea was okay. Um when discussing MSK he had no muscle pain, no joint pain, and no edema in his lower extremity. He had no dizziness or confusion or gait changes. Um when reviewing the um the labs his troponin and BNP were normal and when looking at the chest Xray it displayed cardiomegaly with uh no edema or infiltrates.

Student 007,.mp3,Student 007.mp3,"Today I saw Dr. Or Mr. Leslie palmer he’s a 62 year old male. He came in complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue uh and has been progressing throughout the last 6 months with the last 3 days getting gradually worse uh and very severe today. He came to the emergency department at the recommendation of his primary care physician who suggested that he come. Um he is having dyspnea even at rest and has to sleep upright so orthopnea as well. Uh past medical history pertinent for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Diabetes for the last 15 years, atrial fib for past 5. His surgical history is positive for a coronary artery bypass graft and a and 5 cardiac stents. He has maxed out on stents and the cardiologist indicated no further intervention. Family history for maternal, his mom has breast cancer and his dad paternal has uh Alzheimer's but he is still alive. As far as social history is positive for tobacco use he is a smoker for the past 30 years um no alcohol no drugs. He is employed and has a regular balanced diet and he used to exercise but is now unable to due to the shortness of breath and fatigue. And he lives with his spouse his wife. Current medications atorvastatin 10mg, clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day, the atorvastatin was once a day, furosemide 20 milligrams twice a day, metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams once a day, lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, metformin 500 twice a day, and warfarin 2.5 milligrams twice a day. He is compliant in all those medications. No known drug allergies. His review his review of symptoms is uh positive fatigue, weight gain, um shortness of breath so the dyspnea the orthopnea, he also has positive wheezing and lower extremity edema. He is awake, and alert, and orient times four but he is fatigued. Uh vitals today temperature 98.6 normal, heart rate 90 normal, uh respiratory rate 22 so a bit of tachypnea, resp or blood pressure 80/50 so very low blood blood pressure and oxygen saturation 86% so low. Uh jugular venous distention was present on physical exam but there were no carotid bruits. On auscultating his heart, I did hear a gallop but no murmur, no friction rub, and he did have tachycardia with a PMI pulse of maximal impulse displaced laterally. Lungs uh were positive for rales and wheezing but no chest wall tenderness. Um as far as his lower extremities I did auscultate or I did check his pulses those were full and equal. He did have some pedal edema but his calves were nontender and Homan sign negative. Imaging um we did chest x-ray results with cardiomegaly pulmonary edema. 2D echo with indicated dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction less than 30. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm but left bundle branch block. And his labs troponin was elevated at .04 and BNP was elevated at 4000. So I indicated that he's diagnosed with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. I did explain this to the patient. His new york heart association classification is 4 as he is unable to carry on physical activity even at rest. His disposition we should admit him to the ICU in serious condition check his vitals every 2 hours. I think he should be on strict bedrest and the nurses should strict ins and outs, daily weights, and check for DVT prophylaxis. I recommend a sodium low sodium diet and if we indicate fluids we should keep his vein open for now. Um as far as medication changes, I would like continue his warfarin and his clopidogrel but change all his other ones. Um add on disopyramide 100 milligrams once a day and change that metformin to an insulin sliding scale. Since his oxygen saturation is so low at 86 I would like to place him on BIPAP and uh order the labs serial troponin and PT/INR. For consultation, I'd like to consult interventional cardiology so that they can check for if he's a candidate for a pacemaker either AICD or CRT. Other than that we should get Mr. Palmer into the ICU and see if we can help um get his shortness of breath and fatigue figured out and get that oxygen saturation much higher.

Presents to the ED with shortness of breath and fatigue. 2 weeks ago he was walking with his buddy and began to feel shortness of breath, felt tired, and felt like he ready to pass out. He felt concerned about that because every time he exercised he would feel like he was ready to pass out got really tired. Saw his family medicine doctor 3 days ago and it was they told him to get if it got worse to go to the emergency room and that’s why he’s here. He’s alert and oriented times 4. He is fatigued right now. His vital signs his heart rate was 110 a little high and his um pulse ox was 96% his temperature blood pressure and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Now with the HPI and review of systems he had no chest pain he did have palpitations but it got worse with activity and exercise but it did it got better with rest. And he was negative for orthopnea. Um past medical history he had a hypertension, he has a cardiac cath 1 year ago due to an abnormal EKG but the results were normal. Now his family medical history his mother had a sudden cardiac or sudden um cardiac death his father passed away of a myocardial infarction. She passed his mother passed away at age 40. His medications right now he’s on lisinopril 10 milligrams one-uh once a day. He has no known drug allergies. His social history was negative for anything pertinent. He’s an elementary school teacher he does use moderate amount of caffeine. And he used to exercise and was active but he can’t right now because of the fatigue. He has well balanced diet and he’s married. Now review of systems, he was positive for fatigue, palpitations, he was negative for chest pain and he had he was positive for presyncope episodes. He did have dyspnea. He was positive for wheezing. He was negative for hear- head, ear, eyes, neck and throat. Negative for skin, negative for musculoskeletal, and negative for neuro. On physical exam he did not have any jugular vein distention nor bruits. But he did have a heart murmur with an S4 heart sound gallop. And his lungs were clear bilaterally and equal and no lower extremity edema no um deep vein thrombosis as well. Negative Homan’s sign. His Xray showed cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema. Um echo showed asymmetric hypertrophy with ejection fraction about 60% showing that there’s some hypertrophy going on. EKG had tall R wave in the septal leads and normal sinus with left ventricular hypertrophy of a cri-criteria. And labs were normal. With the EKG, echo, Xray this was leading me towards familial cardi- familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with um stage 2 NYHA 2 class heart failure. So we are gonna I was what we can run this over but thinking of admitting him telemetry, vitals every 2 hours, ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis, daily weights. Put him on some oxygen because that pulse ox was a little low put him on 2 liters um keep it above 96%. He’s serious. We are gonna have activity as tolerated though. And we’re gonna keep that vein open. We’re no- we’re not gonna do any fluids right now because its uh some type of heart failure we don’t need to do that right now. Now we’re gonna keep him on regular diet. We are gonna discontinue that lisinopril and put him on disopyramide sorry about that 100 milligrams 4 times a day. Make sure he doesn’t have any anti- or arrythmias. I did consult interventional cardiology for an automatic internal cardiac defibrillator. Make sure that it’s pumping well.

Um she is compliant with her lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and she’s also taking pred- prednisone 10 milligrams for her um sarcoidosis. Uh she states that she’s up to date on her vaccinations as well. Um for her review of systems that was uh negative for weight loss but she did have 10 pounds of weight gain. Um she endorses uh fatigue she denies any fever or chills. Um she states that uh skin findings were negative. Um there was no head and neck findings significant. Um she states that she um um she doesn’t have any chest pain at all but she does have palpitations. She does have that pre- presyncope that I discussed. Uh she denies any cough or wheezing but she does endorse um some dyspnea and orthopnea. Um she endorses right leg swelling as well. Um she denies any muscle pain or any back pain or any joint pain. Um she there was no uh neuro findings so no dizziness uh no changes to her gait um and she note no confusion at all. Um her vital signs were she had a uh SpO2 of 91%, uh respiratory rate of 20, um heart rate 110, uh temperature 98.6 and BP of 136/99 and she was alert, oriented and and she was um awake and fatigue as well. Um oh on physical examination she had JVD and no bruit no bruits. Her heart rate was regular and her systolic she had a systolic murmur with an S4. She had no rubs or gallops. Her PMI was in a normal position. Um there was no chest wall tenderness. Her lungs uh were present with uh biba- bibasilar rales and wheezing. Um she had 1 plus pitting edema on her lower extremities. She had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were full. Uh no tender- tenderness in the calf and her homan sign was negative bilaterally as well. She had no tissue texture changes on um uh thoracic spine screening. I no red re- reflexes. Um no uh somatic dysfunction in the thoracic region as well and no anterior chapman points um positive. Chest Xray presented with pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, normal cardiac silhouette. And her 2D echo presented with restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness of  and ejection fraction of 55%. Her- her EKG presented with normal sinus rhythm with nonsustained vtach. And her CBC CMP were negative. PT/INR were negative um troponins were negative but her BNP was elevated at 4000. And I believe that she has class uh 3 new York heart association heart failure with a history of uh pulmonary sarcoidosis and hypertension. So our plan is to admit her to telemetry. We’re going to um we’re going so she’s in serious condition. We’re gonna get vitals every 2 hours um she is allowed to get out of bed with assistance. Uh we’re gonna get daily IOs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis. We’re going to get um give her some O2 via nasal cannula. We’re gonna uh maintain her O2 sat at uh more than 96%. Sh-shes gonna be placed on a low sodium diet on a sa- saline lock. We’re gonna continue lisinopril 10 milligrams and amiodar- and we’re gonna put her on amiodarone 150 IV, up her uh prednisone to 60 milligrams daily and add furosemide 40 milligrams to diurese her. We’re gonna get a repeat CMP and we are going to send her to interventional cardiology for AICD placement and we’re going to send her to a nuclear med or radiologist for an FDG- uh PET scan. So um thank you very much it was great it was a pleasure to see this patient.  ",can’t understand at 3:32. ,
Student 013,.mp3,Student 013.mp3,"Mr. palmer presented to the ER um he is a 62 year old white male and he presented to the ER with complaints uh 2 weeks ago he noticed he was having dyspnea and fatigue um when he was going on his daily walk with his his friends and that typically doesn’t happen. And since those 2 weeks he’s noticed it’s gotten worse in particularly this morning what made him come into the ER was that his dyspnea was so bad his wife brought him into the ER. Um he doesn’t have any pain and he did say that one of the alleviate factors is that when he rests the shortness of breath gets better the dyspnea gets better. Um he hasn’t tried any treatments um he just described it as regular severity and really the only complaint he came in was with um shortness of breath and fatigue. Um looking into some relevant history he does have a history of hypertension which he takes lisinopril for- which he was taking lisinopril for regularly. He also um on his family side his mother had died of sudden cardiac um event his father had passed away from an MI age 59. Um his past surgical history he had a cardiac cath put in other than that no other hospitalizations um no other relevant history he’s not a smoker he doesn’t take any illicit drugs use, doesn’t drink. Um he has the like moderate cup of coffee a day um before this he did say he was pretty active regularly um it’s just now with the shortness of breath and fatigue he can’t exercise as much as he used to be able to. Um so then I conducted a physical exam um examining cardiac and pulmonary systems. Um when listening to his hearts I did notice a positive systolic murmur an S4 gallop. I also noticed that his PMI was laterally displaced um however everything else was normal. Uh didn’t hear any rales or anything lungs sounded good uh found nothing in the OMT screen. Um oh along with dyspnea he did mention wheezing that he would occasionally have. Uh his vitals when I had examined him heart rate was particularly high it was at a heart rate of a 110, um his blood pressure was normal and his oxygen was normal. But I told him I would that we would be concerned about that heart rate being particularly high. Um and then I moved on to review labs and imaging with him. So his troponin and his BNP BNP were normal all his bloodwork labs were normal. Um his Xray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Um his uh EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy I mean i'm sorry his ECHO showed left ventricular hypertrophy and so did his EKG with ta- tall R septal waves. Um and with that finding and the physical exam findings and his family medical history we came up with the diagnosis of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so I told him that we would be admitting him to the telemetry unit um along with changing his lisinopril like stopping lisinopril and putting him on disopyramide and that he would be able to get out of bed as needed but we would have you know his vitals tracked every 2 hours. We’d give him a couple standard nursing regulations like uh O2 nasal cannula, um DVT prophylaxis, all of those. And um I did let him know that we would refer him to an interventional cardiologist um for an AICD placement along with uh potentially referring to a cardiothoracic surgeon since he does likely have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to see if we could get either a myectomy done or some alcohol inventions to help um relieve some of that left ventricular outflow obstruction. Um uh I did ask if he had any family or friends in the area his wife brought him in so I let her know that we were gonna admit him and if she could bring you know some stuff that he would need and um if they need any any support other than that um ",,
Student 014,.mp3,Student 014.mp3,"Mr. Leslie Palmer is a 62 year old male who to the emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and fatigue for the past 2 weeks. The patient reports worsening of symptoms with exertion and also experiences palpitations and shortness of breath with activity. He states that at times he feels light headed and like he might pass out but denies any syncopal episodes. He reports the symptoms improve with rest and denies chest pain. The patient went to his primary care doctor today to uh for the worsening symptoms where he they did diagnostic testing and sent him to the emergency department for further evaluation. The patient has a medical history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago. Immunization are up to date. And he has no previous hospitalization. He had a heart catheterization 10 years ago which was normal. His mother passed away um suddenly at the age of 40. And his father passed away from an MI a- at 59. He denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. He has a balanced diet with regular exercise. He’s an elementary school teacher and lives with his wife. He takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily for his blood pressure and he has no known drug allergies. Review of systems was positive for fatigue, generalized weakness, presyncope, and palpitations, shortness of breath. He denied fever, chills, weight changes, bruising, lesions, rashes, weakness, sensory changes, headaches, changes in vision, neck stiffness, hearing changes, and chest pain. Vital signs um his heart rate was 110, 96% oxygen saturation on room air, respiratory rate of 16, temperature 98.6, and blood pressure of 130/90. He was awake, alert, oriented, in no acute distress. He’s well developed well nourished male. He had no JVD, no carotid bruit, no chest wall tenderness, no epigastric bruit or tenderness. Normal um posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, negative homan’s sign, no lower extremity edema or calf tenderness. He had a normal rhythm sys- sys- systolic murmur with a S4 and the PMI was displaced laterally. The lungs were clear to auscultation. And he had no chart- TART changes. For his um labs his troponin and BNP were both within normal limits. His chest Xray showed cardiomegaly and his ECHO showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with um an ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed sinus rhythm at 90, normal axis. Um LVH voltage criteria and tall R waves in the septal leads. So for this patient we are going to admit him to telemetry for the diagnosis of hyp- fam- familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy NYHA class 2 and a secondary diagnosis of hypertension. His condition is serious and will be getting vitals every 2 hours. He has no known drug allergies. Activity as tolerated. We’ll put him on a regular diet and have DVT prophylaxis and an O2 nas- oxygen nasal cannula as needed to maintain a saturation of greater than 96%. We’ll put in an IV fluid saline lock discontinue the lisinopril and start disopyramide 100 milligrams four times a day. We don’t need any other labs or imaging at this point. We will consult with interventional cardiology for potential AICD placement. And we’ll also consult cardiothoracic surgery for um possible septal myectomy or alcohol injection. Um we discussed the plan of care with the patient. He denied any other questions. And he understood and agreed with the plan of care. The patient has insurance and lives with his wife who is his support system. ",,

Of note, patient does endorse having flu like symptoms about 2 weeks ago and endorsed uh experiencing a fever, cough, and rhinorrhea at the time which has since resolved however the dull chest pain and shortness of breath during her flu is still present which is why she is with us today. Of note she has been experiencing palpitations, myalgia, joint pain, uh breathlessness and fatigue with activity. Um Ms. Palmer is normally active twice a week but lately has been unable to exercise due to fatigue and shortness of breath. She also endorses uh orthopnea and must quote sle- see- uh sleep sitting up in a chair every night end quote. She has a history of hypertension and takes lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral everyday consistently. She has no known drug allergies. No illicit drug use, alcohol, or tobacco use. Of note patient did specify that she did have a cardiac cath conducted 1 year ago during her annual physical which yielded no significant findings. No other hospitalizations. And her emertl- her maternal family history includes a mother who died of breast cancer and a father who has Alzheimer’s and is currently living in a nursing facility. Her support system at home is a husband and she works as a elementary school teacher. She denies any dizziness, confusion, syncope, headache, back pain or neck pain. Her vitals include a temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, heart rate 110, respirations 20, blood pressure 130/90, and O2 sats 91% on room air which I placed on her on uh 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen supplemental to help her breathe. Um her heart rate and respirations are consistent with her um palpitations. Um during her physical exam I did hear some bilateral bibasilar rales and wheezing as well as noticed some JVD in her neck and 1 plus pitting edema in her lower extremities. Her heart was regular no murmurs, rubs or gallops. No rashes no nuchal rigidity. And she had no uh abdominal or carotid bruits. No calf tenderness, negative homan’s sign and carotid and and uh uh dorsalis pedis uh her carotid and dorsalis pedis pulses were present 2 plus equal and bilateral. Her uh labs and imaging include an elevated troponin of 0.1 and um BNP of 4000. Uh her chest Xray showed a cloudiness of her lung vessels and kerley B lines consistent with pulmonary congestion um or pulmonary edema as well as cardiomegaly due to increased cardiothoracic ratio. Her 2D echo showed um dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30%. Her EKG showed sinus tach with a right bundle branch block left axis and a PFC and a P uh PVC. Um due to her presentation and diagnostic imaging today I believe that she would be she should be admitted to telemetry with a diagnosis of myocarditis um dilated cardiomyopathy and is a class 2 on the NYH scale for heart failure. Um secondary diagnosis is uh hypertension. I consulted interventional cardiology for a AICD and CRTD pacemaker assessment and radiology a contrast MRI. During the encounter I did not get the chance to but I would also like to would have liked to consult infectious disease for a consideration of immunoglobin or glucocorticoids for treatment management. I also ordered a diagnostic serial troponin, CMP test, and a repeat 2D echo. I also would have liked to um oh I also uh like would like to order uh lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral, Tylenol 625 milligrams per oral every 6 hours for pain and furosemide 10 milligrams IV to reduce her edema and heart strain. Um to also reduce uh the stress on her heart I also would like to order a low sodium diet and oral fluid restriction. Maintain her O2 sats above 96% uh via nasal cannula. Patient was understanding to the plan and agreed with the service and she was advised to um uh continue her uh balanced food diet and um physi- and uh increase her physical activity her um sorry take it easy on her physical activity.

Uh and uh proceeded to almost pass out felt like he was going to pass out. Uh his past medical history is that he was he’s um he has hypertension he has a cardiac cath uh his past his uh family history is that his mother died of sudden death and his father died of an MI. I think his uh his mother was 40 and his dad was 59. His sister is fine though. So that heart cath and the he he had an EKG and a heart cath those were both about a year ago. Um his social history is he doesn’t use alcohol, he doesn’t use tobacco, doesn’t use illicit drugs. He is an elementary school teacher. Uh he eats a balanced diet and um he drink a couple cups of coffee a day. Exercises um as often as he can. He said usually walks everyday but for the past 2 weeks hasn’t been able to because of this shortness of breath that he’s been having. Uh he lives with his wife as well. His previous medication that he was on was lisinopril 10 milligrams per oral. Uh he has no known drug allergies. Um his review of systems is that he has fatigue, um uh palpitations, presyncope, wheezing, and dyspnea. Uh patient on uh initial uh examination was awake and aware and oriented. Uh his heart rate was a little his heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22 so uh very slightly uh uh tachypneic. And uh his blood pressure uh he was hypotensive it was 80/50 I believe. And O2 level was 86%. So we uh on physical examination he had no carotid bruits, no JVD, um let’s see uh no JVD uh regulatory regular uh heart rate. Murmur was present with an S4 and uh a systolic murmur was present with S4 and a gallop. Um his PMI was normal. He was clear his respiratory area was clear to auscultation. Nothing obvious in there. His calves were nontender. He had no pedal edema. He had negative homan’s sign and all of his peripheral pur-pulses were full and equal. His chest Xray appeared uh to have cardiomegaly and it was kind of iffy but I uh said he had pulmonary edema it was just a little cloudy in there not incredibly obvious but a little cloudy. Uh his 2D echo said that he had left ven- his left ventricle was asymmetric and hypertrophic with a um with an EF value of 60%. Um his EKG had normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria and tall R waves and septal waves really pointing to um familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His uh troponins were within normal they were 0 and his BNP was less than 100 which is within normal. Um his uh level of dyspnea was a um I said it was NYHA score of uh 3 because uh he said he really struggled to breathe when he would just walk on on very slight uh slight things so has marked limitation of physical activity. Uh patient’s uh I had decided it would be uh quality idea to admit to telemetry. Uh patient’s condition was serious. Uh ordered vitals for every 2 hours. And activity with assistance. Uh nursing interventions all kind of uh generalized and normal strict IO, O2 2 liters per um minute via nasal cannula maintain O2 sat greater than 96%, DVT prophylaxis. Uh diet regular because he doesn’t anything that uh indicated otherwise and um IV fluids were just keep vein open. Uh no uh no pain medicine we changed his lisinopril to disopyramide 100 milligrams per oral um everything else I believe was negative we just gave none. Uh his in patient consultation that recommended was interventional cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. Uh interventional cardiology specifically for a uh an AICD so that just in case his heart were to uh suddenly stop we restart it and get him over to the hospital. And uh cardiothoracic surgery we uh I uh suggested uh septal myectomy and or a uh alcohol uh ablation as those would uh effectively reduce his uh primary issue that being his septal hypertrophy which was um um present on the 2D echo. ",,

Student 018,.mp3,Student 018.mp3,"a 62 year old pat- uh male patient presented to the clinic today with shortness of breath and fatigue. Um and the history of the illness the patient stated that the that he was on a track on a run or on a walk and then experience a shortness of breath and um fatigue as well as palpitations while he was walking his with his friends. The patient mentioned that um there was um that uh he experience palpitations within the next 20 minutes upon the onset of the shortness of breath. This event occurred a couple weeks ago and has not improved ever since. And the patient’s shortness of breath and palpitations as well as fatigue exacerbated with physical activity. In terms of the review of systems um um patient experienced fatigue, no cough, fever, malaise or any kind of uh illness or any kind of cold like symptoms but experienced weight gain um of for the past couple of weeks. Um patient mentioned there was uh palpitations but with no chest pain. Um along with the uh um palpitations patient experienced uh dyspnea and uh raspy breathing. In terms of the past medical history the patient um has a past medical history of um receiving a cardiac catheterization in an outpatient clinic. Um medical history wise, patient has been diagnosed with hypertension. No known um allergies. Um in terms of the social history the patient is on balanced diet uh tries to uh exercise regularly. Doesn’t take illicit drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Drinks 1 cup of coffee every day. Um patient is also a teacher so is currently employed. Patient has been sexually active with um his significant other but hasn’t tried ever since the onset of symptoms. Um um the patient has no hospitalizations and um in terms of family history the patient uh the patient’s mother experienced sudden death in the family um and his father experienced a myocardial infarction at the age of 69 and unfortunately died um from that. The patient’s medication the patient is on lisinopril uh 10 milligrams uh QID. In terms of physical history um the patient is positive for um jugular venous distention but had no carotid um bruits bruits. In terms of a heart auscultations they were irregular. There was no murmur, frictional rub, or gallop. The PMI was displaced laterally and um there was no chest wall tenderness. In terms of the chapman point um there was no um such um there were no positive chapman uh points. For the lungs uh the patient have a bibasilar rale and um experienced wheezing in the upper quadrant um in the superior lobes. For the m- for msk uh physical exam there was a nontender calf uh with pitting edema of the lower extremities. But the pulse the dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibialis um pulses were present and symmetric. Um in terms of the vitals the patient um the only abnormal vital was uh the heart rate which was 110 beats per minute all the other vitals temperature being 98.6 blood pressure was uh 130/90, the pulse ox was 96% and the respiratory rate was 16 uh beats was 16 per minute. Um all those others were normal. In terms of diagnostic imaging the patient um the patient had cardiomegaly in the chest Xray the 2D echo revealed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy um and that’s because of an increased interventricular septum as well as an enlarged lym- left ventricle um uh left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. The EKG reveal a normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute um with an abnormally tall R wave in the septal leads particularly in V1 V2 and V3. Um this suggests the interventricular septal septal hypertrophy due to a large anterior voltage and that suggests that there’s a this fits the LVH uh voltage criteria. The labs were uh unremarkable in terms of everything being normal so uh troponin levels were normal BNP was normal CBC and CMP were normal. Um a procedure with the uh EMR um and the consult so I diagnosed the patient as familial hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy explained that the disease in which the this was a disease in which the heart muscle became thickened um which makes it harder for the heart muscle to pump blood and because it’s so thick, it’ll cause abnormalities in the electrical conduction. Um in terms of the new York heart association the classification was uh 2 because of the fact that uh with slight there was slight limitation of physical activity. Um even though the patient was comfortable during uh rest. Um he mentioned that the physical activity resulted in fatigue, palpitation, and um shortness of breath which is why it led me to believe that it was NYHA classification of 2. For the MR the EMR treatment plan and counseling um I uh admitted I told the patient that he was going to be admitted to telemetry because it was a serious condition with q2 vitals, activity as tolerated. Um nursing intervention include I and O daily, daily weight uh obtaining um dai-daily weight measurement, DVT prophylaxis, and the patient would be on um 2 liters uh 2 liters per minute on a nasal cannula to make sure that the pulse ox was above 96%. Diet was um I instructed the patient to be on a regular diet um IV fluids wise it would be KVO. Um in terms of medications um I instructed the patient to be discontinued on uh lisinopril but started on uh disopyramide with uh 100 milligrams uh QID. Um there is no diagnostic labs or imaging required. I did mention to repeat an EKG reading once at the hospital just to make sure that is no repeat of the um the tall uh just to make sure that is not uh just to track the tall R waves if there was uh any feature uh EKG abnormalities. In terms of special- specialists or consults instructed the patient to vis- to have um uh an interventional cardiology visit then for an AICD placement and uh cardiothoracic surgery to visit uh uh for septal myo- myomectomy or um alcohol injection to reduce the LVOT. ",,
Student 019,.mp3,Student 019.mp3,"Um okay, so the patient that presented to me today was Leslie Palmer. Uh she's a 62 year old female. Um she was alert, um awake, uh fatigued and oriented, um but her vital signs showed that her heart rate was 90, her blood pressure was 80/50, respiratory rate was 22, O2 sat was 86, and her temperature was 98.6. Um her chief complaint was shortness of breath and fatigue at rest. Her um she described uh progressively worsening shortness of breath over the last 6 months. Um her shortness of breath was noted uh while lying down at rest and physically, and when physically active. Um she noted that she had started, she began sleeping um in a chair at night to relieve her shortness of breath when sleeping. Um her past medical history was pertinent for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago as well as uh atrial fibrillation diagnosed 5 years ago. Um her medications include, uh at the time of presentation, her medications included um metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams lisinopril 10 milligrams atorvastatin 10 milligrams metformin 500 milligrams furosemide 20 milligrams clopidogrel 75 milligrams and warfarin at 2.5 milligrams. Uh her surgical history shows um a coronary artery bypass grafting, as well as a 5 drug eluding stents within the last year. Um family history showed that her father uh is alive at 89 years old, but uh does have Alzheimer's disease. Um her mother is deceased, um deceased at 80 years old due to breast cancer. Social history shows that she follows a balanced diet, moderate exercise, no illicit drug use. Um she has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years. She does not drink alcohol. She has moderate caffeine consumption. She's employed and she does have a social support system. Um so her general review system shows that she uh has um claimed that she has fatigue and an 8 pound weight gain over the last couple weeks. Um in addition, so her skin was negative for any bruises, rashes or anything of the sort. Um her head and neck exam uh was negative. Cardiovascular exam uh showed an irregular rate um with uh no murmur or friction rub, um as well as uh a regular uh PMI was normal upon inspection. Um for her respiratory or her um sorry according to her she was not presenting with anything. Her um pulmonary ROS shows wheezing orthopnea and dyspnea. Her MSK, uh she claims uh lower extremity edema and neuro was good. On her physical exam, uh we found in the neck uh no carotid bruit. Uh she did have um jugular venous distention. Uh she was tachycardic. Um she had a normal PMI. Uh no friction rub or murmur uh or gallop noted on auscultation. Uh respiratory exam showed uh bibasilar rales and wheezing. Um and that concludes the physical exam portion. So for orders, we um sent her to the ICU, took vitals every 2 hours, put her on strict bed rest, a strict IO, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. We placed her on BiPAP. Uh for labs, we ordered PT/INR and serial troponins. Um for her medications, we discontinued metoprolol, uh uh li- lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and furosemide. We continued her clo- clopidogrel and warfarin, and we added dobutamine, as well as placed her on an insulin sliding scale. Um and post visit, we consulted interventional cardiology for potential uh AICD or CRTD placement. Thank you, and this concludes my uh case presentation. ",,

She went and saw her primary care physician 3 days ago um and then got a lot worse today, called them and they said to come to the ED. So she presented to the ED with a chief complaint of um fatigue and shortness of breath. Um she has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoid. Um she had a cardiac cath a year ago and it came back normal. Um she had a family history of um cardiac sudden death on her maternal side. Her mother passed away at 40 and her father passed away um from a heart attack. Um her vitals were 139/99 um blood pressure, her O2 she was a little bit hypoxic she had uh 91. Um a little bit of tachycardia she had uh 110. Um respiratory rate was 20 and temperature was normal at 98.6. Um and so then um we did a intake. We did um social history. She doesn't use alcohol, drugs, tobacco. She drinks coffee just a cup a day. Um she's currently employed she’s a school teacher. Um she is unable to exercise. Uh she's an NYHA of 3. Um so rest does help, but every other kind of activity does make her um have her symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath.

Um she had a bit of a weight gain about 8 pounds. Um and again fatigued, no skin um ROS, no HEENT ROS. She did have a presyncope. She's never passed out, but she does feel like she's going to pass out. Um she said she had a fluttering in her chest and actually used the word palpitations. Um she's got dyspnea, orthopnea, wheezing, um some lower extremity edema. Uh she did have JVD. Um, all of her neuro ROS was negative, uh no gait changes, no confusion. Um, she's awake alert oriented. She's just tired fatigued. Um, she didn't have any cardiac bru- or no carotid bruits. She did have JVD. Um, she had a regular heart rate. Her PMI was normal on inspection. Um there was a murmur there was an S4 murmur and there was a gallop um no friction rub and um no regular rate. Uh, she did have wheezes and bilasel bilat- bi laser rales um she had no chest wall tenderness um and was on respiratory distress. Uh her calves were not tender. She did have um +1 pitting edema. Um her pulses um her peripheral peripheral pulses were full and equal. Um she did not have a Homan’s sign. Um so then we did her imaging and her Xray. Um she showed normal heart size. Uh she did have pulmonary um edema and some mediastinal fullness as well as um she had the characteristic pawn broker sign on chest Xray. Um her labs did show a um elevated BNP at 4000 and I informed the patient of what that meant um and her echo came back with um a restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness, ejection fraction of 55%. Um she I gave her the diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Um and I admitted her to telemetry, her condition serious. I did vital q2, um out of bed with assistance, um nursing intervention, strict IO daily weight, uh 2 nasal cannula, maintain her O2 sat cause she was a little bit hypoxic at 91. Um we did low sodium uh KVO IV fluids. Um and I continued her lisinopril at 10 milligrams. I upped her prednisone to 60 milligrams, um amiodarone because her EKG did show that she had um nonsustained ventricular um tachycardia. So she had 3 or more um of the consecutive ventricular beats in V1, V2 and um V3. Uh the axis was normal. Um and it was a normal sinus rhythm as well. Um so she had an EKG cardiac dysrhythmia, a nonsustained vtach. So we would place her on amiodarone 150 IV. Um so I also put her on some furosemide 40 milligrams IV uh to help with that fluid in the legs. Um no endocrine, no BiPAP. Uh we did order a CMP. Um we did no more diagnostic orders and I consulted a radiology and an interventional cardiologist um for an AICD placement and a po- possible PET scan. Um other than that, um I believe everything else on her physical exam we have covered um and we admitted the patient to telemetry. Thank you. ",at 2:58 I didn’t know how to spell how she said bibasilar rales. ,
Student 021,.mp3,Student 021.mp3,"I just met with Leslie Palmer. He's a 62 year old male who presented the ED with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue that's gradually worsened over the past 6 months. Um he's unable to carry out any exercise and is having symptoms at rest. He expressed that he's been sleeping in a chair at night um because he can't lay down because of his shortness of breath. Um he denied any pain and stated that he went to his family med doc 3 days ago and they told him if it gets worse um to go to the ED, so that's why he came in. His past medical history, he has hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and afib, and his immunizations are up to date. Um for his meds he's on atorvastatin 10 mgs every day clopidogrel 75 mgs every day furosemide 20 mgs twice a day metoprolol succinate 50 mgs every day lisinopril10 mgs every day metformin 500 mgs twice a day, and warfarin 2.5 mgs twice a day. Um he has had a CABG 12 years ago and he had 5 stents placed and the cardiologist said he doesn't qualify for any more stents. Um his dad is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's and his mom died of breast cancer. He has a balanced diet. He walks every day, um doesn't use illicit drugs. He's a pack a day smoker. Um we talked about potentially quitting. He doesn't drink alcohol, um drinks a cup of coffee a day. He's a school teacher and he's married and lives with his family. Um, he has no allergies and for his review of systems he expressed fatigue and an 8 pound week in the past 2 weeks. Um he has swelling in his legs no skin, eyes, ear, nose, and throat or neuro problems. He denied palpitation, syncope and chest pain, and he has wheezing, dyspnea and orthopnea. His vitals, his temp was normal at 98.6. He uh has a heart rate of 90. Respiratory rate was up at 22. His BP was hypotensive at 80/50 and his oxygen was low at 86%. On physical exam, I found no carotid bruits. He did have JVD, no murmurs. Um he was tachycardic. His PMI was displaced laterally. Um he had wheezing and rales, but he wasn't in respiratory distress and he had chest wall tenderness. His calves weren't tender. He had pedal edema and his posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses were full and equal. On his imaging um he had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Also got an echo done that showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction less than 30%. And he also got an EKG that was normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block. His troponins and BNPs were elevated on his lab work. So my differential was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy um myocarditis dilated myo- cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy. Um but I diagnosed him with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy because his medical history of having hyperl- uh hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and having all those stents place and his echo showed that he had a reduced ejection fraction. So I went ahead and admitted him to the ICU. He's in serious condition um get vitals every 2 hours, still strict bed rest, strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, he's on a low sodium diet, KVO IV fluids. I discontinued all his meds except for his clopidogrel and warfarin and I added a dobutamine IV drip. Put him on insulin sliding scale and he's on BiPAP for his low oxygen. Um I ordered to repeat the PTT/INR and serial troponin labs and um I ordered him to have a consult with the interventional cardiologist for an ICD or CRT placement. Um but he has a good support system with his family to take care of him, and he seemed like he was in good spirits and just really wanted to have his symptoms go away. So hopefully the medication we give will help with that.",,

Student 024,.mp3,Student 024.mp3,"Reporting on Mrs. Leslie Palmer who presented today to the emergency department, complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a dull achy chest pain that began about 2 weeks ago. She noted that about this time about 2 weeks ago, she was sick with flu like symptoms, but these symptoms resolved about 5  days ago these flu like symptoms specifically. However, her fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain have only gotten worse over the past several days. Um she knows that she is unable to exercise to her normal limits without her- without these symptoms, and she's been sleeping in a chair at night due to pretty severe orthopnea. She denies taking anything to alleviate her symptoms, and she rates her symptoms at a 2 out of 10. She does have a past medical history of hypertension for what she is taking with lisinopril. She also has a surgical history of a cardiac catheterization. She is an overall pretty healthy patient who exercises regularly and has a balanced regular diet. She's also up to date on all of her immunizations. As for her ROS, she does present with fatigue and she notes some recent weight gain that's abnormal, about 8 pounds in the last week. She does have chest pain and discomfort. And she also notes some fluttering in her chest. She notes dyspnea dyspnea and orthopnea. She also notes joint aches and pains as we- along with lower extremity edem- edema. Um her vital signs today were temperature of 98.6. She was tachycardic at 110 beats per minute, and tachy- tach- ta- tachypneic at 20 um rates per minute. Her blood pressure was also a little bit elevator- elevated at 130/90 with her O2 a little low at 91%. She did, on physical exams, she did have jugular venous distention. Her PMI was displaced a little bit laterally, but she was at a regular rate with no murmur friction rub or gallop. On respiratory exam, she did have wheezes and rales, but there was no chest wall tenderness. As for extremities, she did have obvious lower extremity lower extremity edema, but her pulses were full and equal and her calves were not tender. She also had a negative Homan’s sign. For her chest Xray, she did have some cardiomegaly and some pulmonary edema with a normal mediastinum. Her echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at less than 30%. Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with sinus tach and a right bundle b- right bundle branch block. Her troponin was a little bit elevated and her BNP was elevated at 4000. So with all of this, I decided that she's probably experiencing myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So with this, I did decide to admit her to telemetry. Um we're doing strict Is and Os with um DVT prophylaxis, a low sodium diet. I'm gonna place her on acetaminophen for some of this chest pain. I'm gonna keep her on her lisinopril, but I am gonna put her on furosemide to clear out some of that fluid. As for lab orders, I'm going to do a CMP to monitor her potassium since we're adding the furosemide. I'm also gonna check serial troponin levels since they were elevated. I'm gonna repeat her echocardiogram. I'm also going to consult an interventional cardiologist, a radiologist and an infectious disease physician. Um interventional cardiologist to consider an AICD, CRTD placement, a infectious disease physician to take a biopsy and assess immunoglobulin and glucocorticoids, and then consulting radiology to do an MRI to look for any changes that could be caused by this myocarditis.

Student 026,.mp3,Student 026.mp3,"I saw Mr. Palmer today. Leslie is a 62 year old male who presents to the ER for the chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. Mr. Palmer has been experiencing these symptoms for 6 months and saw a family medicine physician 3 days ago who ordered tests but did not go through them with him. The PCP referred him to the ER for which he is here today. He reports symptoms that have progressively been worsening and he needs elevation when sleeping using a recliner. The fatigue and shortness of breath have um been constant at rest and worsened with any and all physical activity. Mr. Palmer has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with metoprolol succinate 50 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, metformin 500 mg, furosemide 20 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and warfarin 2.5 mg. His social history includes a balanced diet, moderate exercise with daily walks with friends from his neighborhood. But uh recently he reports having increased shortness of breath by walking. He has no drug or alcohol use and smokes a pack a day. He consumes 1 cup of coffee every morning and is sexually active in a monogamous relationship with his wife. His surgical history includes a triple bypass and a stent every year for the past 5 years. However, on his last visit, his surgeon informed him that he will no longer be getting any more stents due to his ejection fraction being below 40%. He is a school teacher and his family history includes his mother passing away from breast cancer and his father who is still alive in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. He is also up to date on all his current immunizations. He appears awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued and after a thorough review of systems pertinent positives include an 8 pound weight gain in the past 2 weeks fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion and wheezing, as well as swelling in his legs. His vital signs showed normal temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90. He was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 22, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50, and a hypoxic and hypoxic with a pulse ox sat of 86%. Physical exam findings showed jugular venous distension, no carotid bruits, tachycardia with a split S2, and a displaced PMI laterally. His lungs on auscultation showed bibasilar rales and a pitting edema was also palpated in his lower extremities. Diagnostic lab work showed an elevation of troponin and a BNP of 4000. Chest Xray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with the left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%. EKG was interpreted to show normal sinus rhythm and a left bundle branch block. This led me to my diagnosis to be ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, um which is classified as class 4 heart failure by the New York Heart Association.

Student 027,.mp3,Student 027.mp3,"Uh so Mrs. Palmer is a 62 year old female, um coming with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. Um so she had been seeing her uh PCP, and over the past 2 months, her symptoms of shortness of breath had worsened. And so her doctor told her to come into the emergency department. Um she presents today and has shortness of breath. Uh she also complains of palpitations uh presyncope. Um she says these symptoms have been worsening over the past 2 months, but she denies any sort of chest pain. Uh she says the shortness of breath is constant. She feels it even when she's at rest. Um in terms of her medical history, she has a history of hypertension, a history of uh sarcoidosis. Um she does not have any allergies. Um she actually says that she used to exercise once per day, but because of her symptoms, this is uh decreasing and she's no longer able to walk every day like she used to. Um she says that she has gained uh 8 pounds over the past 2 weeks. Um then on physical examination, I found a I found uh jugular venous distention, uh no carotid bruits. Listened to her heart it sounded regular I did hear a soft ejection murmur with an S4, no rales, but I did hear a gallop. Uh PMI was normal, there was no chest wall tenderness. Um when I was listening to her lung sounds, I heard bibasilar rails along with wheezing. Um when looking at her legs, I saw pitting edema on both legs. Uh her pulses were equal and her calves were non-tender. Um looking at her labs, her troponin was normal, her BNP was 4000. Um the Xray the heart size looked normal. I did see some like hilar consolidations. Um on echo, it showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with the increased wall thickness, but her ejection fraction was normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and right bundle branch block. So with all of this, I think what's going on is that she is having a uh sarcoidosis cardiomyopathy, um an exacerbation of her of her pulmonary sarcoidosis. Um so what I want to do is I want to admit her uh to the telemetry unit. Uh I'm going to consider or continue her lisinopril.

Uh she says the shortness of breath does not improve with um Tylenol or I'm sorry her physical activity causes her shortness of breath. Um she has a constant chest pain that is dull and is not alleviated by Tylenol. She said out of a scale of 10, her pain is 2. I give her a NYH score of 3 due to her um decrease in physical activity. And she has to sleep in a recliner. Uh when I did my physical exam um there was a positive JVD, as there were no cardiac bruits. There was some uh lower extremity edema. The neuro exam was negative. Uh pulmonary, she had rales, orthopnea, dyspnea, and wheezing. Um cardio her PMI was displaced, as well as experiencing palpitations and chest pain. Um and then just in general, she was oriented, but she was fatigued and had some slight weight gain, probably due to the edema. Her labs are CBC, uh PT/INR negative, troponin was slightly elevated, BNP elevated, uh chest Xray showed pulmonary- pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Our 2D echo showed uh dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block, as well as a left axis deviation. Um after speaking to the patient and doing the physical exam, um I decided that she had myocarditis dilated dilated cardiomyopathy. Uh so we are going to admit her to telemetry, uh condition serious. She has no known drug allergies, vitals every 2 hours, her activities as tolerated. Um she's gonna be on strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis. Um her O2 sats were lows at 91% so we're going to put her on O2 via nasal cannula and maintain an O2 sat of 96%. Put on a low sodium diet and fluid restriction. Put on a saline lock KVO. She is currently on lisinopril 10 milligrams so we're going to keep that, but we're also going to add uh 625 milligrams acetaminophen every 6 hours to help with the pain and then uh furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to try to get rid of some of that fluid. Um we're gonna keep uh an eye on her troponins. We are gonna repeat the echo and we are gonna do CMP. We will be consulting uh interventional cardiologists for a CRTD and AICD placement to help get her rhythm back to normal, um as well as a infectious disease to consider for glucocorticoids.

Student 029,.mp3,Student 029.mp3,"Good afternoon. I would like to present to you a patient I've just finished seeing at the emergency room. Uh Mrs. Palmer is a 62 year old female with a history of hypertension, who presents with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue with accompanying chest pain. Uh these symptoms have been occurring over 2 weeks and are worsening. Uh she describes the chest pain as sharp, central, non-radiating and a 2 out of 10 severity. Uh symptoms are worsened with uh some exertion and symptoms are alleviated by rest and sleeping in a sitting position. Uh no treatments have been tried at this time. Uh the patient also noticed that a recent illness consisting of fever, headache, coughing, and runny nose that dissipated 5 days ago uh most recently evaluated by her PCP 3 days ago. Ms. Palmer currently takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day uh for her hypertension and claims no known drug allergies. Social history significant for a cardiac catheter 1 year ago with no complications. Family history showed a living father with Alzheimer's and a deceased mother who passed of breast cancer 5 years ago. Uh Mrs. Palmer's social history is described as a regular diet with no tobacco, drug, or alcohol use with moderate caffeine intake and insufficient exercise. She is currently employed as an elementary school teacher and lives at home with her husband of 30 years. Uh review of systems demonstrated an alert oriented patient uh in pain. Uh there was a weight gain of 8 pounds over 2 weeks noted um as well as lower extremity edema. Uh cardiology noted heart palpitations, chest pain, and pulmonology assessment uh demonstrated orthopnea, wheezing, the shortness of breath. Uh dermatology, HEENT, and neurology review of systems were all non-contributory. A focused physical exam was assessed with uh negative Chapman's points and bilateral equal uh TART changes anteriorly and posteriorly in the thoracic area. Physical exam was significant for jugular vein distension, uh 1+ pitting edema, 2 + bilateral pulses bibasilar rales, regular heartbeats uh with no murmurs, rubs or gallops with the displaced PMI laterally. The homan’s sign was negative. Vitals were assessed and were significant for tachycardia at 110 BPM, uh elevated blood pressure at 130/90, tachypneic at 20 breaths per minute, and hypoxic at 91% oxygen saturation. And no fevers noted. Labs revealed elevated troponin at 0.10 and elevated BNP at 4000. Chest Xrays showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, while ECHO showed enlarged left ventricle with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 30%. Uh EKG showed a left axis sinus tachycardia with premature ventric- ventricular contractions and a right bundle branch block. A diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association stage 2 was made uh with admission to telemetry. Patient will be placed on acetaminophen 625 milligrams by mouth every 6 hours um as well as furosemide 40 milligrams via IV uh while continuing her lisinopril. I will consult a interventional cardiologist for CRTD uh AICD placement, as well as endocardial endomyocardial biopsy. Uh infectious disease will be consulted for immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, and uh radiologists will be consulted for immediate enhanced MRI. Uh diets will can change of consist of low sodium and oral fluid restriction. We'll be placing an IV fluid saline lock uh with strict IO daily weight DVT prophylaxis and O2 via nasal cannula maintaining the O2 saturation above 96%. Vitals will be taken every 2 hours and we will order a serial troponin and a repeat 2D echo. Thank you very much.  ",,
Student 030,.mp3,Student 030.mp3,"So for today's case, we have a 62 year old male presenting with fatigue and shortness of breath. Patient reports symptoms begin about 6 months ago, but then 2 days ago they got worse. So he decided to come in and um see us. So he described a dyspnea and a fatigue that is constant even at rest, which in which I gave him a NYHA class 4. He feels quote unquote, generally tired, sitting up relieves the dyspnea activity worsens it. Um so he has orthopnea and sleeps upright at night because it feels better for him. He has not tried any self-medication, no self-treatment. He rates the fatigue as an 8.9 8 or 9 out of 10. So as vitals, he was hypotensive with 80/50. He's tachnep- tachypnea with fast heart rate um no fast breathing rate sorry, respiratory rate of 20. His low oxygen SPO2 was 86%. So in his review systems, he's positive for fatigue. He recently gained 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks, which suggests fluid buildup. He has wheezing, shortness of breath, and orthopnea. He has bilateral lower leg edema. Past medical condit- past medical history consists of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes for the last 10 years, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and he's an active smoker. Medications, he takes atorvastatin clopidogrel furosemide metoprolol succinate lisinopril metformin and warfarin. He has no known drug allergies. So in the physical exam, the remarkable positives were he has tachycardia with a split S2, he has jugular venous distension, um his PMI is displaced laterally, he has rales wheezing, lower extremity edema. Um all the other findings for negatives were unremarkable. Chest Xray shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo shows normal sinus rhythm I mean sorry his EKG, my fault. His EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block and left ventricular hypertrophic voltage criteria. On his labs, his troponin is elevated and his BNP is 4000. His echo shows dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. The primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and the secondary diagnosis that I gave him were because of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Um so his actually his family history that's pertinent. Um so his mom is passed away at 80 from breast cancer and his father is still alive. He's 88. He has Alzheimer's. So that's the for the um so the pri- we're going to, so now for our treatment plans, I want to admit him to the ICU. His condition is serious. I want vitals done every 2 hours. I want to limit him to strict bed rest. Nurses are going to give him strict IO daily weight and DVT prophylaxis. For fluids, he's KVO. We're gonna give him a low sodium diet. We're gonna hold everything for his medications except the clopidogrel and warfarin, and I'm gonna add in a dobutamine IV drip. And yeah, dobutamine IV drip. We're gonna put him on a BiPAP, and we're gonna get P for lab we're gonna get PT/INR and serial troponins. We're transferring him to interventional cardiology for AICD and CRT um CRTD placement.  ",,

Student 032,.mp3,Student 032.mp3,"64 year old female presents with shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. 2 weeks ago she had an infection associated with a cough, cold, and fever, but it has now resolved. Now she's feeling pain in her chest and it increases um her shortness of breath increases with exercise and the shortness of br- breath is release relieved by sitting. She's not been able to lay down because of her um shortness of breath and that pain. So she's been sleeping in the chair in the chair for the past few weeks. Um her review of systems shows that she has fatigue and gained 8 pounds in the past 2 weeks. She has palpitations and chest pain. She experiences wheezing, dyspnea and ortho orthopnea and she has swelling in her legs. She they are no pertinent findings in skin HEENT and neuro. So past medical history, she has been diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril 10 mg every day. She currently has no known drug allergies. Surgical history includes a cardiac cath a year ago. Um but other than that, no hospitalizations. Her family history shows her mother passed from breast cancer um a coup- 5 years ago and her father is currently living in a facility a nursing home because he is he has dementia. Social history shows she has a balanced diet, exercises 2 times a week, but hasn't been able to because of her shortness of breath, doesn't do any illicit drugs, tobacco or drinks alcohol. She drinks a cup of coffee a day. She is currently employed as an elementary school teacher. And has a partner for 30 years who is her support system. So after conducting the physical exam, I found a positive JVD sign. Her PMI was displaced laterally. Bibasilar rales pedal edema and with no chest wall tenderness and her um pulses in her extremities were um 2+. Her vitals show she had an elevated heart rate at around 110 beats per minute. Her O2 sat was at 91% and her BP was slightly elevated at 130/90. Her lab values showed she had elevated troponin and BNP levels. Her echo shows reduced ejection fraction with dilation of left ventricle. Her EKG shows a right bundle branch blo- block and sinus tachycardia. Chest Xray showed she had pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. After looking at all these values and um conducting the physical exam and getting her history, I'm diagnosing her with myocarditis cardiomyopathy. A secondary diagnosis could be a dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy but given her recent recent um infection a couple weeks ago I am going to assume it is the myocarditis cardiomyopathy. So my plan for her right now is to admit her to telemetry and administer acetaminophen for the pain she's feeling acetaminophen 625 and IV furosemide for the swelling in her legs and keep her on that lisinopril. Nursing orders include strict IO, daily weight check, DVT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula, and maintain her O2 sat greater than 96%. I’m gonna talk to infectious disease the cardiologist and radiologist to come up with a plan for this patient. This includes CRTD and AICD placement, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids and a medical medically enhanced MRI. Cause of her um myocarditis is because of her recent um infection that she's experienced 2 weeks ago. And her she currently does have insurance because of her job, and her husband will be meeting her at the hospital. ",,

She is a 62 year old uh woman who presents to the office for a chief complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, heart flutter and palpitations. Ms. Leslie was in her usual state of excellent health um until 2 months ago when she developed worsening um shortness of breath and palpitations. She reports um the symptoms being better at rest and when she's elevated and worse during physical activity. She does feel like um passing out at times. She does not complain of radiating pain. Um Ms. Leslie does have a history of sarcoidosis, which she was diagnosed um 25 years ago and is currently being treated um for hypertension with lisinopril along with the along with lisinopril, she reports taking prednisone as well. She has no known allergies. Her social history includes a balanced diet, limited exercise, no drug use, no tobacco use, um no alcohol use, and moderate caffeine use.

Student 034,.mp3,Student 034.mp3,"Mr. Leslie Palmer presented to the emergency department today with uh shortness of breath and fatigue. Uh claims it's been happening for the past 6 months, getting worse uh as the 6 months progressed. Saw his family medicine doctor uh 3 weeks ago or 3 days ago. Excuse me. And they were uh gave him some tests. Told him they were gonna talk about the test in a few days. It got worse. They called him he called him and said to come back to go to the ER. So he's here in the ER today uh says the symptoms have been like I said, getting worse. They're worse when he lays down the shortness of breath. So he's been sleeping in the chair the past few weeks, he says. Um there has been he has a history of multiple stents placed that have 5 in the past 5 years, I believe, and also a uh open heart surgery uh CABG um 12 years ago, 15 years. Uh he has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and was recently diagnosed with atrial fib. Uh no drug allergies. Pack a day smoker for the past 30 years. No alcohol or drug use. He is employed as an elementary school teacher uh has insurance through his work and a married family support system. Um no relevant uh family medical history. Currently medicated on lisinopril metoprolol, atorvastatin, metformin, furosemide, clopidogrel, and warfarin, all for the previous diagnosis said before. Uh presented uh well dressed, well nourished, uh oriented. He uh was very oriented, just fatigued, um did not seem to be seem to be in any apparent pain. Review systems shown uh he had uh a JVD present. Uh no carotid bruits. Uh he’s tachycardic with a split S2 heard on auscultation. Uh no heart murmurs or gallops or fric- friction rub. He had uh laterally displaced uh PMI on palpitation. Um listening to lung sounds, he had uh rales were present also, like you said orthopnea can't uh can't breathe while lying down short of breath dyspnea with exertion wheezing. He also says the fatigue and shortness of breath is even on rest. So go into a class 3 heart failure. Um on his labs he came back um PT/INR was elevated and as well as troponin and BNP. Uh 2D ECHO showed that uh he had a dilated cardiomyopathy with uh ejection fraction of 30%. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis, probably because of that cardiomegaly and that uh lateral PMI uh left bundle branch block and uh left ventricular hypertrophy hypertrophy voltage criteria was met. Uh chest Xray shows uh edema cardiomegaly. So we went ahead and diagnosed him with ischemic um excuse me ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Uh with uh reduced ejection fraction, 30%. Gonna administer him to the ICU. Uh it's a serious condition. We're gonna get his vitals checked every 2 hours. Uh strict Is and Os, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis. Uh gonna get him on a Bipap 16 over 6 50% uh saline with a KVO. Gonna pause all of his uh current meds right now, except for the warfarin and clopidogrel. Uh go ahead and add a dobutamine drip drip because of that low blood pressure and also his vital showed a low blood blood pressure of 80/60 80/50 excuse me with a heart rate of 90 oxygen sats 86%. So that's why we want to go and get them on the Bipap dobutamine for that low blood pressure. Uh also insulin keep track of those sugars, keep him stable. Uh go ahead and order more serial troponins to check how he's doing as well as PT/INR since he's on that warfarin. Uh with that afib we don't want any extra clotting to occur. From there going to go ahead and uh give him uh interventional cardiology consult potential for a uh CRTD and AICD uh placement. Other than that uh seemed present happy, just fatigue and troubled. So hope we'll get him taken care of. Alright. Thank you. ",,
Student 035,.mp3,Student 035.mp3,"Hello Dr. Rawlins, I'd like to present the case of Mr. Leslie Palmer. He is a 62 year old male who presents today with shortness of breath and severe fatigue. Um this all started about 6 months ago, but has gotten worse in the last 3 days. He went to see his primary care physician and was instructed to come to the emergency department. He said he doesn't know any of the test results that he um took at the primary care physician. Um the shortness of breath occurs even at rest, and he's forced to sleep in his recliner due the symptoms worsening when lying down so um he really doesn't feel good today and like it's been bad around the clock pretty much. Um he is uh from my review of systems I see he's he said that he has fatigue, had an 8 pound um has gained 8 pounds in the last week. He's experiencing wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea and lower extremity edema. Everything else was negative. His prior medical history he does have hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes and recent afib. Um his past family history his mother died at the age of 80 from breast cancer his father is still alive, but in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. Um for some pertinent surgical history, he did have a CABG12 years ago. He's had 5 stents in the last 5 years, with the last one being in his LAD. Um his cardio, his cardiologist has told him he is not able to get any more stents after this. And his most recent Echo showed a 40% ejection fraction. Um for his medications he is treating his medical history. Um he does he is on lisinopril 10 mgs atorvastatin 10 mgs clopidogrel 75 mgs metformin 500 mgs furosemide 20 mgs metoprolol succinate for 50 mgs and warfarin 2.5 mgs. He does not have any known drug allergies. Um as for his social history he claims to eat a balanced diet. He used to go on walks daily, but due to his recent symptoms has not been able to. Um he has been smoking for the last 30 years about a pack a day. He consumes caffeine, just 1 cup of coffee a day. No tobacco or alcohol. Um he is an elementary school teacher teaching 5th grade and he is sexually active with his wife, who's also his social support system at home. His vital signs showed a temperature of 98.6 respiratory rate of 22, uh blood pressure of 80 / 50 and a SPO2 of 86% which is a little low. Um from my physical exam, some pertinent positives were uh JVD tachycardia with split S2 and a gallop. Um his PMI was displaced laterally. He did have bibasilar rales and wheezing, and 1+ pitting edema in his lower extremities. The negatives were there were no bruits, no regurgitations, no chest wall tenderness, no calf tenderness. And pulses were full, full and equal dorsalis pedis pulse. Uh my primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with um NYHA class 4 due to the symptoms being present at rest. Uh my secondary diagnoses are hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes. So my plan for this patient is to admit him to the ICU. Um his labs also showed elevated troponin and BNP, so I would like serial troponins taken. Um as for his um other lab results, he did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension on chest Xray. Um his EKG had a left bundle branch block and left axis, and his echo had a dilated left ventricular left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction from his last one down to 30% this time. Um in the ICU, I would like him to be on strict bed rest, uh I and O's, daily weight, and DVT prophylaxis. Um I am going to put him on Bipap 16/6. A low sodium diet and um put in a IV just to keep the vein open. As for meds, I am going to keep him on his clopidogrel and warfarin of 75 and 2.5 mgs respectively. I am going to add in IV dobutamine and uh put him on an insulin sliding scale. Um for his labs, as I said, I would like serial troponins, but I'm also going to get a PT/INR and I am going to consult interventional radiology to put in a CRTD and AICD. I think all with all these combined you can really get Mr. Palmer where he needs to be. Thank you so much. ",,

Student 039,.mp3,Student 039.mp3,"Mr. Leslie Palmer, who is a 62 year old male, with a history of hypertension, and presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and a pre-syncope episode 2 weeks ago while walking. The um associated um episode was with dyspnea that was aggravated while walking and any kind of physical activity. But was relieved with rest therefore it falls under the New York Heart association classification of 2. The patient also described wheezing as well as rasping and fluttering that um last for a duration of any kind of exertion. Patient described there was no history of cough, chest pain, no weight loss, or fever, chills, or sweats. the patients risk factors for coronary artery disease include a positive family history of a MI on the fathers side that passed away at 69 years old and a maternal medical history of sudden cardiac death. Currently, patient is taking Lisinopril for their hypertension and has no known drug allergies. They did have surgical history of heart cath and as for their social history they have a balanced diet and were very active exercising but as of now they have shortness of breath while walking, moderate consumption use of uh caffeine, and no consumption of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. They are uh elementary sorry they are middle school teacher that lives with their husband. So as for their vital signs, the um the patient has uh vitals of blood pressure of 130 over 90, uh temperature of 98.6, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, and uh saturation of oxygen of 91 percent and they appear to be awake alert and oriented. I performed a cardiac pulmonary physical exam that indicated no carotid bruits, and did have a jugular venous distension. Um they had a regular heart rate, no murmurs, friction rub or gallops present but a laterally displaced PMI. As for respiratory had no chest wall tenderness, uh but wheezes were present with no respiratory distress. In their extremities, their pulses were full and equal with uh non tender calves and no pedal edema. I reviewed uh imaging of a chest xray that indicated cardiomegaly as well as uh an echo that indicated left ventricular asymmetry uh with hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 60 percent. And their EKG uhh read to be a normal sinus rhythm with a left ventricular hypertrophy criteria and tall R wave in the uh septal leads. Their um labs came back showing their troponin BNP levels as not elevated, therefore my assessment for this patient is a that they have familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to their hypertension and uh this is because of the family history of sudden cardiac death and normal cardiovascular markers in their labs. Thats umm why I would like to admit this patient to telemetry for serious condition and checking their vitals every 2 hours. Um and indicated activity as tolerated with nursing interventions of daily weight, strict IOs, a nasal cannula oxygen maintaining their oxygen saturation above 96 percent and DVT prophylaxis keeping them on a low sodium diet and uh IV fluid orders for keeping the veins open. No uh pain medications but I would like to add disopyramide 100 mg per oral and discontinue the Lisinopril in order to manage any dysrhythmias that they are experiencing. Um no labs are needed to be ordered as well as no imaging but refer in for consult to interventional cardiologist for a AICD placement defibrillator as well as cardiothoracic surgery. Um consult for a septal myectomy  for the inflammation and um management of the hypertrophy. Thank you. ",,
Student 040,.mp3,Student 040.mp3,"62 year old female um named uh Leslie Palmer. She reported to me today with a history of shortness of breath and fatigue um so the uh the shortness of breath um and the fatigue had been progressively worsening over the past 6 months and um uh at her visit today she had she had reported that the shortness of breath was occurring even at rest. so any sort of physical activity um even just walking down the hall she reported um uh shortness of breath. and um she is having to sleep in a chair for that reason at night um so she did have a positive orthopnea um and again at it is um it is at rest and with physical activity. Um so uh additionally she has been um in the past 2 weeks she has reported that she has gained about 8 pounds um and getting into some of her medical history um she does have a history of hypertension, uh hyperlipidemia, um diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Uh surgically she has a history of um about 12 years ago she had a triple bypass surgery. She's also had 5 uh stents placed uh in total and they did inform her that she is not a candidate for further stents. Um she was informed by um previous physicians that her ejection fraction um was about 40 percent. Um getting into some of her her medications um she provided me with a list she she was on a good number of medications um to name them she was on lisinopril, Metformin, uh Warfarin, Metoprolol succinate, um she was on uh Furosemide and um uhh so that's it for the medications. She did not have any drug allergies um. Some of her social history uh she has a good uh balanced diet. She did report that she is actually able to walk daily um even though she did state that she uh is experiencing shortness of breath with any physical activity um she is still was making the effort to walk everyday um which is very good and she does not report any uses of illicit medications or over the counter medications other than what is prescribed to her. She does have a 30 pack year history um sorry 30 year history of smoking um for which she has been smoking one pack per day. No alcohol consumption and um she has been drinking about one cup of coffee everyday. Uh as far as her sexual activity she is married um and it is a monotonous relationship and for her living situation she is living with her husband. Um so getting to some of her vitals um her blood pressure was significantly low at 80 over 50 um her pulse at about 90 and her oxygen also low at about 86. Um and her respiration rate was a little bit elevated at 22. Um and i did discuss that with her um and talk about um you know what was um standing out in in regards to her vitals as well. So um getting into her physical er or physical exam sorry she did have um positive jugular venous distension, um however she did not have any carotid bruit. Uh she did have some um swelling in her in her calves um so she was positive for lower extremity edema um however, her um her Homans sign was negative. So um getting into her lab work um so troponin and BNP were both elevated um INR was not elevated. Um  Her echo was showing a reduced ejection fraction of about 30% so she had reported in the past that physician told her it was about 40 and today it was 30 so um uh it possibly could have could have gone down. um her EKG was showing a left bundle branch block um and so using those findings i i um my my diagnosis was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Um and and for which i i decided to discontinue a lot of the medications that she is currently prescribed and I I however I did keep her on her blood thinners so I kept her on Warfarin and i kept her on the Clopidogrel. Um and I also added Dobutamine for her blood pressure as it is um quite low and  I added um some insulin um because she is diabetic and she has not been taking insulin um so I added insulin as well. Um I also admitted her to the icu um because of her lab work and because of her her symptoms um I just wanted to make sure that she can be continuously monitored monitored taking uh taken good care of. Um so other than that would be my encounter. Thank you very much for listening. Bye. ",,

She reports that she cannot catch her breath but states that there is no accompanying chest pain. She describes orthopnea in which reclining improves her symptoms and her symptoms worsen with activity. In terms of Leslie Palmer's past medical history, she has reported atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and her immunizations are up to date. In terms of past surgical history, she reports a previous cardiac stent, in fact there have been 5 cardiac stents, and she is no longer a candidate for any future ones and she has also undergone a um a bypass bypass graft or a CABG. In terms of her maternal family history, her mother has passed due to breast cancer and her father is alive but is suffering from Alzheimer's. In terms of her social history, she reports no alcohol use, um tobacco use active about a pack per day and no illicit drug use. She is currently employed, her diet is regular and balanced, she reports one cup per day in terms of caffeine, she exercises regularly prior to having these symptoms. Now she can no longer exercise and uh she lives with her husband. In terms of medications, she takes Atorvastatin, Clopidogrel, Furosemide, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Metformin, and Warfarin. And in terms of drug allergies, she has no known drug allergies. Uh when assessing her ROS, she does suffer from fatigue, she reports weight gain, there have been no skin um abnormalities, and when it comes to HEENT there are also no abnormalities. And when assessing her chest report no chest pain no palpitations. They were all negative when it comes to her lungs. Uh she reports wheezing again uh orthopnea as described and dyspnea. When it comes to muscular musculature she does have lower extremity edema. and in terms of her neurological examination, there was nothing er it was all negative. Uh her vital signs were a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 90, uh rather high respiratory rate at 22, a low blood pressure hypotension at 80 over 50, and her SPO2 was also at 86 which is low. Uh when assessing her neck, there was JVD present and when assessing her heart during physical exam, we noticed no murmur and her PMI was displaced and there was some tachycardia as well. Um when listening to her lung sounds, we found there was both wheezing and rales. In terms of her extremities, we found um pedal edema and decreased pulses and in terms of imaging she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on the chest xray. Uh when we assessed her 2D echo we found that there was a left ventricular ejection fracture of less than 30 percent and in terms of imaging when it came to the EKG we found uh normal sinus rhythm at 90.  Um there was a left bundle branch block and there was also uh criteria that met left ventricular hypertrophy. Her troponin levels were elevated and her BNP was at 4000. I came to the diagnosis of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy based off of her lab values and her patient history. Her NYHA classification will put her at a uh level of 4 where she cannot carry on physical activity due to her symptoms and the plan that was uh the plan would be to admit her to the ICU because her serious her condition is serious. this would necessitate checking her vitals every 2 hours as well as strict bed rest. And when it comes to the nurse, it requires um a strict intake and out outflow monitoring as well as a daily weight monitoring and also DVT prophylaxis in case her symptoms cause um clot or embolus. In terms of her diet, we would prefer to be low sodium and IV fluids we should keep the vein open. In terms of medication, there is no necessity for pain meds. However for cardio vasculature, we should prescribe Clopidogrel, Warfarin, and Dobutamine. Uh there is no need for diuretics at this moment and because this is a diabetic patient, it would be best to put her on the  insulin sliding scale. And again based off of her oxygen saturation and her increased respiratory rate, I decided to put her on BiPAP. In terms of diagnostic lab orders, uh PT and INR because of the Warfarin and Troponin to see if there is any change in her uh her heart status and then there is no need for any new imaging at this mo at this point. However in terms of consultations, I did recommend an interventional cardiologist. This would be for both in a AICD placement as well as a CRTD placement which could deliver a shock as needed.

Um her echo her echo shows restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55 percent. Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, nonsustained ventricular uh nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. My leading differential diagnosis is sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with a New York Heart Association uhh rat rating of 3. As far as the  car cause goes, I explained the patient that most likely this is due to the pulmonary sarcoidosis that went to her heart and um resulted in arrythmia and congestive heart failure. As far as assessment and plan goes, I am admitting the patient to tele tele tele telemetry sorry condition is serious, allergy is none, vitals um two every two hours, um she can be out of bed with assistance.

In reviewing her systems, Ms Palmer reported recent weight gain of 8 pounds, edema in her ankles, um she also noted palpitations, chest pain, and wheezing. Positive for dyspnea and orthopnea. On physical exam, Ms. Palmer noted JVD and pitting edema. I did note a left displaced PMI and no carotid or epigastric bruits or murmurs. Rales and wheezing were noted bilaterally on lung sounds. I ordered a chest xray, echo, labs, and an EKG. On chest xray, I noted cardiomegaly and  diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema. Her echo indicated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction under 30 percent and she had an elevated troponin and BNP. Her EKG indicated tachycardia, left axis deviation, PVCs, and a right bundle branch block. Because of her negative cath 1 year ago and lack of comorbidities, I ruled out coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. Her family history rules out sarcoidosis or other inflammatory cardiac conditions. Due to her recent fever, my primary diagnosis is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with a NYHA class 2 heart failure. Her condition is  serious and i will have her vitals monitored every 2 hours. I am going to admit her to telemetry and I will allow activity as tolerated with strict I and O, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and begin oxygen by nasal cannula and 96 until she gets to 96 immediately. I am going to keep her on low sodium and fluid restriction diets. I am going to get an IV but Ill hold fluids and I will reorder a trop and a CMP. I plan to continue her Lisinopril 10 mg, Acetaminophen at 625 for pain, Furosemide of 40 by IV, and I will consult interventional cardiology due to the possible need for CRT and AICD placement and endocardial biopsy, infectious disease, and also the radiologist for MRI to detect myocardial inflammation.

Um when i walked in the room, his vitals showed a blood pressure of 80 over 50 with an SPO2 of 86, and a heart rate of um 90 beats per minute. His past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease with a coronary bar coronary artery bypass graft times 3 12 years ago with an additional stent placed um more recently. He remembers having an ECHO done that showed an EF of about 40 percent a few years ago. He is currently smoking um one pack per day and lives at home with his wife. Um on exam he had positive jugular venous distention, he was tachycardic with a split S2, and had no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His PMI was displaced laterally and he had 1 plus lower extremity edema, with no associated calf tenderness. Um after reviewing his results, we discussed that his chest xray showed pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly. His EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm, with a left axis deviation, and a left bundle branch block and his labs showed elevated troponin and a BNP significantly elevated at 4000. His most recent ECHO that he had done with us showed an ejection fraction of 30 percent and a dilated left ventricle. Given this, I diagnosed Mr Palmer with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a plan to admit him to the ICU, reorder his PT INR and serial troponins and i kept him on Clopidogrel, Warfarin, Lisinopril, and started him on Dobutamine as a positive ionotropic agent. Um i also told him that the interventional cardiologist would be coming by to consult and um discuss AICD CRT placement to also assess with increasing the heart's pumping power. Um and to consider that as a potential medical device. Um to conclude, patient had no questions for me and was agreeable with the plan. Thank you. ",,
Student 052,.mp3,Student 052.mp3,"I just saw 62 year old male, Leslie Palmer, with a chief complaint of 6 months of fatigue and shortness of breath that has gotten worse in the past 2 weeks which prompted a visit to his primary care provider. Um he explains that he has been sleeping in a recliner due to increased shortness of breath while lying down and that he has these symptoms with all physical activity. Past medical history includes afib, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; surgical history of CABG and bio cardiac stents to which his cardiologist had recommended no further intervention. *** He is a one pack per day ***. Current medications include Atorvastatin, Clopidogrel, Furosemide, Metoprolol succinate, Lisinopril, Metformin, and Warfarin with no known drug allergies. Upon review of systems, significant findings include fatigue, weight gain of 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks for an unknown cause, um wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema. Vitals uh temp was normal, heart rate was normal, and respiratory rate was normal but the patient was hypotensive with a BP of 80 over 50 and SPO2 of 86 percent. Upon physical exam, JVD was present, gallop was present with split S2, and tachycardia as well as PMI displaced laterally. There was no respiration distress or chest wall tenderness but rales and wheezing were present. Extremities um the calves were non tender but pedal edema was present. Up uhh upon imaging, chest xray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. ECHO showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30 percent. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, a left bundle branch block, and LVH criteria. Troponin and BNP were elevated. Our primary primary diagnosis is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a NYHA functional classification of 4. Id like to admit this patient to the ICU with serious condition. Vitals checked every 2 hours with strict bed rest, strict IO, daily weights, and DVT prophylaxis as well as a low sodium diet and KVO fluids. Medications i would like to hold his medications except for Clopidogrel and Warfarin and I'd like to add dobutamine IV and insulin sliding scale. Also like to put him on Bipap which would raise that O2 and order PT INR and serial troponins. Id also consult interventional cardiologist for possible AICD placement and CRTD placement.

Um she states that she has had trouble breathing over the past 3 days and she also reports that she had a cold 2 weeks ago including um a fever, sniffle, and some sneezing. She states that her um current symptoms are better when she is in her recliner so she has been sleeping in her recliner um at night to help with these symptoms. When she lays flat, her symptoms are worse and um her symptoms also worsen with um some daily activities which would put her at a NYHA classification of class 2. Um her other pertinent medical history includes a 10 year history of hypertension  which is well managed on Lisinopril. Um 10 mg by mouth daily. She has no allergies to medications and no history of illicit drug use, no history of alcohol use, and no history of tobacco use. She eats a balanced diet and before her symptoms began, she was exercising about 2 times a week um at the gym and she states that she does have a support system at home and her insurance through work as an elementary school teacher. Her father is 89 and is living in a nursing home due to his dementia and her mother passed away at 80 due to breast cancer.

Uh she presented with fatigue um, an 8 pound weight gain in 2 weeks, um she has presyncope uh as well as palpitations and some wheezing was noted. Um entering into the room, her vitals uh were a little uh a little out of the ordinary range but not too bad uh her heart rate was 100, respiration rate was about 20, her blood pressure was 136 over 99 and her O2 sat was 91 percent.

Um on her maternal side there was a history of sudden death um but she presents with no allergies and um her current medication is 10 mg once daily of Prednisone and 10 mg once daily of Lisinopril. Um so as I was uh going through my physical exam, uh there were a few pertinent details. She was positive for JVD, but she didn't have any carotid bruits. Um her heart rate was regular uh but there was a S4 murmur that was noted. There was no regurge um the PMI was normal placement and there was no tenderness on the chest wall. Uh doing a pulmonary exam, there were bilateral rales and wheezing noted um and there was 1+ pitting edema um in her lower extremities. But uh the pulse was equal and calves were non tender and there was negative Homans sign. Um for her labs, BNP was 4000 and um there was restricted cardiomyopathy with a 55 percent ejection fraction noted on the echo those ordered on admission.

Student 056,.mp3,Student 056.mp3,"I just finished seeing the patient in room 1. Patient is a 62 year old female who came into the emergency department due to worsening heart palpitations and shortness of breath breath this morning. Uh the patient has had a history of these symptoms for the past 2 months um and it worsens when she is laying down and upon physical exertion. um it does get better um when she rests and when she sits up. The patient also complains of fatigue so i took her history. The patient has a history of hypertension and sarcoidosis. Um patient is up to date on all her immunizations. She is currently on Lisinopril 10 mg everyday and Prednisone 10 mg everyday with no known allergies. Um patient has a history of uh cardiac catheter catheterization 1 year ago um which did not show any coronary artery disease. Um mom passed away at 40 years of age um and it was a sudden death. Dad had passed away at 59 years of age due to a myocardial infarction. Um patient has uh regular and balanced diet, um and exercises by walking with her friends; however, due to these symptoms recently she has been unable to do that. Uh caffeine around 1 cup a day. No illicit drugs, no tobacco usage, no alcohol usage. Um she works as an elementary school teacher um and lives with her husband of 30 years um has insurance um and then I conducted a review of systems um patient has had unexplained weight gain and fatigue. Um uh review of the skin was uh showed no abnormalities. Um looking at the uh musculoskeletal system there was lower extremity edema edema. Um patient has felt uh dizzy at times um HEENT review of systems was neg negative with no abnormalities. Um patient had uh chest palpitations and presyncope um was also uh she reported symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Um I looked at the vital signs; the temperature was in normal limits was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and was within normal limits. Heart rate was 110 slightly elevated, respiratory rate 20 slightly elevated. BP uh 136 over 99 slightly elevated uh depending on what you look at. O2 was 91 percent um slightly lower than what we want it to be. Um so then I conducted my physical exam. Um she patient was positive for uh jugular venous distention, um patient had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur and there there was signs of gallops. The PMI was nondisplaced. Uh i heard uh bibasilar rales, there was wheezing, uh i confirmed the pitting edema in the lower extremities. Um then I looked at the diagnostic findings. Uh troponin levels were within normal limits and with everything else except for the BNP uhh that was uh at 4000 uh so that was elevated. Chest xray when i looked at it just showed some lymphedema lymphadenopathy. um while looking at the 2D echo, uh the ventricle the chambers were nondilated um there was some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Oh i meant no left ventricular hypertrophy but the walls were rigid. I apologize for that. Uh the EKG findings showed uh normal sinus rhythm and normal axis. Um and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Uh so that lead me to believe that she had uh sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. And so because of that I admitted her to the hospital so that we can uh monitor her. Uh we want to get vitals every 2 hours. I said strict ins and outs, checked the daily weights, uh DVT prophylaxis um because of the 91 percent oxygen saturation and um I set up a nasal cannula and uh for O2 and want to keep that above 96 percent. Uh for diet i have her as a low sodium, uh want to keep the veins open, uh Lisino I'm going to keep her on the Lisinopril 10 mg uh I want to bump up her Prednisone to uh oh keep the Lisinopril at 10 mg everyday. I want to bump up the prednisone to 60 mg everyday. I wanna add on Amiodarone 150 mg by IV and Furosemide 40 mg by IV.

He denies any chest pain. Uh he states that his symptoms were exacerbated with exercise but relieved with rest. He at first saw his primary care physician uh after his symptoms began and had some baseline tests performed  but was unsure what those results were. He states that over the last day or so, his symptoms got worse and was advised by primary care physician to head to the emergency room. He has history of controlled hypertension for the last 10 years uh treated successfully with Lisinopril 10 mg um he had a cardiac catheterization about a year ago which uh was unremarkable. He states that he had it performed due to an abnormal EKG had his yearly uh yearly checkup.

Student 058,.mp3,Student 058.mp3,"ED earlier. She was a 62 year old female, Mrs. Palmer. She presented with a dull, constant chest pain and she noticed she also noted that she was significantly tired and was short of breath. Um and she said this short of breathless, this lack of breath was more noticeable when walking. She reported a prior illness with fever, cough, and um shortness of breath about 2 weeks ago. She said it subsided about 5 days ago however the chest pain remained and she went to her family care doctor who referred her here. Her past medical history is um positive for hypertension. Her past surgical history was a cardiac uh catheterization with no findings. Her mother died of breast cancer in her fifties. Her father is living in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. For her social history, she reports never using alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She is employed school teacher. Her diet she reported was balanced. She has one cup of coffee a day and she exercises at the gym twice a week. Her living situation is that she is with her husband and they are sexually active. Her current medications are 10 mg PO Lisinopril and she has no known drug allergies. Her review of systems revealed positive fatigue, weight gain, no fever in the office today however she again claimed that she had one prior. There were no skin changes present. No rash, no brushing bruising, no lesions. She had no headache, no hearing loss, no neck stiffness, no vision changes, no difficulty swallowing. Her review of systems for her cardiovascular system revealed uh chest pain um that was dull and constant. She was positive for dyspnea, orthopnea, and wheezing. Her musculoskeletal system examination revealed lower extremity edema. She was negative for any neurological deficits. The patient appeared fatigued. Um but outside of that no other distress. Her vital signs were 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit for temperature, heart rate of 110, respiratory rate of 20, pulse uh a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and her pulse ox was 91 percent. further examination revealed no carotid bruits, JVD was president was present, her heart was slightly tachycardic, her pulse rate that is. Her respiratory examination revealed wheezing, bibasilar rales, and no chest wall tenderness. Examination of her extremities, yielded non tender calves, bilateral pulses full and equal, and pedal edema. Her imaging the uh chest xray demonstrated cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. ECHO 2D revealed dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30 percent. EKG findings were sinus tachycardia with preventricular contractions. And her troponin was elevated. Additionally, her BNP was measured at 4000 and her overall diagnosis was myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. I gave her a New York Heart Association scale of 2. I admitted her to telemetry her condit with condition serious, vitals Q 2hours. She was given out of bed with assistance for activity and her nursing interven interventions were to maintain oxygen saturation at 96 percent O2 um 2 Liters, stricts ins and outs, with daily weights. I gave put her on a low sodium diet with orders to keep the vein open. Acetam, I gave her Acetaminophen 625 mg PO for pain and I continued her Lisinopril at 10 mg PO. Additionally, I gave her metoprolol succinate 50 mg um for the heart failure and Furosemide 40 mg via IV for the pulmonary edema and heart failure. I gave sub prescribed no endocrine medications, no respiratory therapy. I ordered repeat serial troponins and a repeat 2D echo. Referred her to the interventional interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist for potential consult of an AICD pacemaker er pacemaker and endomyocardial biopsy. And in lastly her EKG revealed a heart rate of 114 again with PVCs and left axis deviations. That is all I have for you today. Thank you for your time. ",,

She is uh presenting to the ED today with uh chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Um she said her symptoms of fever and cough started 2 weeks ago which stopped in the last um 5 days ago. But then her chest pain and shortness of breath and her fatigue began 5 days into that um and have worsened. um she notes having um palpitations as well and dyspnea dyspnea on exertion with slight activity. Um and then also said that nothing really helps and that she has orthopnea at night which causes her to sleep in a recliner. Um her fever and cold symptoms have subsided but uh noted that overall these newer symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue um continued on and then worsened. She has a past medical history of hypertension as well as um taking Lisinopril 10 mg a day for. Um she is compliant with her medication and denies having any allergies to medications. She also had a cath 1 year ago um which was due to EKG changes but noted that uh the cath was negative and then she also has um no she denies smoking um drinking or using any drugs but also uh notes that she used to workout at least twice um twice a week in the gym and hasn't been able to lately due to her new symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue. Um her overall vitals were um heart rate of 110, uh pulse ox was normal, her um O2 saturation was a little low at 91 on room air, her high blood pressure was at 130 over 90 and her respiratory rate was at 20. Um when I did her physical exam, um she did have lower extremity edema um she did not have a murmur um but she did have JVD, uh no bruits, and her PMI was displaced laterally. Um when auscultating her lungs, she did have bibasilar rales and wheezing um and then after looking at the labs, there was elevation in her troponin and BNP. Her troponin was a 0.1 and her BNP was 4000. Um through the echo, um we saw an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent um and her cardiac xray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Um and with her EKG there was um a right bundle branch block as well as left axis deviation and tachycardia um consistent with her vitals. Um she notes that she did not take any medications for this and none of that has helped nothing else has helped uh and with these results I diagnosed her with myocarditis myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy um and then let her know that I would like to admit her to telemetry um and to see an interventional cardiologist uh to potentially get an endocardial endocardial biopsy done as well as potentially an AICD um and then to also see an infectious disease specialist because her myocarditis could be a continuation on from that infection 2 weeks ago. Um so having the infectious disease specialist check on her immunoglobulins would be helpful. and then also to see a radiologist for a more in depth MRI um on her heart. Um she was agreeable to all this. Um  and to also change her medications um to continue her Lisinopril but also add on Furosemide uh for the diuretic uh to get rid of that extra fluid in her and then also Acetaminophen uh for her pain. Um so overall uh she was very agreeable to this to this plan and um I did diagnose her with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. ",,

So Mrs Palmer is a 62 year old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. She said she was sick sick 2 weeks ago and experienced sniffling, congestion, fever, cough, and chest pain as well as shortness of breath. About 5 days ago, she said her symptoms began to get better but she continued to have dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue. These symptoms are improved when she rests, but are worsened when she begins to exert herself. She is also experiencing orthopnea and is sleeping in a recliner at night.

At the time of previous illness, the patient had pyrexia, fatigue, palpitations, cough, and wheezing. Um approximately 5 days ago, the pyrexia resolved but they started experiencing arthralgia, myalgia, progressive dyspnea, and chest pain. The chespnea the chest pain and dyspnea get better with rest and sitting but they get worse with moving around. NYHA class 2. The patients blood pressure and heart rate were slightly elevated at 130 over 90 and 110 respectively. The O2 sat was low at 91 percent. Temperature normal at 98.6.

The patient had no relevant neuro, HENT, or skin issues. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension for which they take Lisinopril 10 mg once a day for. Um they have no known drug allergies. They had a previous heart cath approximately 1 year ago with no pertinent findings and the patient has not been hospitalized or had any other types of surgery. Um the patient's mother died of breast cancer approximately 5 years ago and her father is still alive with Alzheimer's in a care facility. Um for social history, patient states she has a balanced diet and exercise prior to this viral illness approximately 2 weeks ago typically going to the gym 2 times a week. The patient reports no drug, tobacco, or alcohol use and moderate caffeine consumption. Um Mrs. Palmer is employed as a teacher but is currently on summer break. The physical exam showed jugular venous distention, bilateral rales, and wheezing. Exam of the lower extremity showed 1 plus pitting edema, no murmurs or bruits on physical exam and pulses were 2 plus bilaterally. Um I diagnosed her primarily with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. Secondary diagnosis of hypertension. The plan is to admit this patient to telemetry under serious condition. Get nursing instructions to be vitals q 2 hours, activity as tolerated, strict I and O, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, O2 nasal cannula to keep oxygen sats around 96 percent or above, low sodium diet, and to keep the veins open. Id like to continue the Lisinopril 10 mg orally and add Acetaminophen 625 mg q 6 hours. Id like the patient to be on a low sodium diet and I would like to start patient on Furosemide 40 mg IV. As far as labs and other tests go, I would like to obtain serial troponins, a CMP, and to repeat the echo. I would also like a biopsy and immunoglobulin testing. For referrals, I would like to see interventional cardiologist for a potential CRTD and AICD. Id also consider doing an infectious disease consult for myocarditis as well as consult radiology for a potential contrast media enhanced MRI.

Upon presentation, patient is awake, alert, and in no acute distress. His vital signs include a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, an O2 saturation of 96 percent, and a temperature of 98.6. Patient is also complaining of maybe wheezing. He states that he feels like he is wheezing but he doesn't actually know for sure so he doesn't know if he can say yes but he doesn't feel comfortable saying no. Patient denies any recent illnesses. The remainder of the patients review of systems was negative. Patients past medical history includes hypertension for which he takes 1 10 mg tablet of Lisinopril daily. Patient is compliant with his medication. Patient's past surgical history includes a cardiac cath around a year ago which according to the patient, was normal at the time. Patient's mother suddenly passed away at age 40 and patient's father died at age 59 from a myocardial infarction. Patient reports that he eats a balanced diet, has 1 cup of coffee per day, and does not drink any alcohol. Patient does not use any tobacco products and denies any illicit drug use. Patient works as an elementary school teacher and he does have insurance. Patient is married and is sexually active with his partner. Patient has no known drug allergies. Physical exam demonstrated no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits. Patients heart was a regular rhythm and he had a systolic murmur with a S4 heart sound. Patient had no rubs, but he did have gallops. Patients PMI was displaced laterally. He had no chest wall tenderness and his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He had no lower extremity idea edema. His DPPT pulses were full and equal bilaterally. He also had no calf tenderness. He had a negative Homans sign. Patients bloodwork demonstrated that his troponin and BNP levels were within normal limits. His chest xray showed cardiomegaly but no pulmonary edema or mediastina mediastinal fullness. His 2D echo demonstrated left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 60 percent and increased interventricular septum. His EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with LVH voltage criteria and tall R waves in the septal leads. Results demonstrate that the patient has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to his hypertension and his family history. This will require admission because his condition is serious. In the hospital, patient's activity will be as tolerated and he is able to eat a regular diet. Medication wise, patient will be given Dysopyramide 100 mg by mouth everyday. We will discontinue his Lisinopril. Patient will also require vitals Q 2 hours, keep vein open fluids, strict I and Os, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, and we want to maintain his O2 sats at greater than 96 percent. Consult to interventional cardiologist for an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myectomy and alcohol injection will need to be placed. Patient's wife is in the waiting room and would like to go up with to would like to go up with the patient if possible. Thank you so much for your time. ",,
Student 063,.mp3,Student 063.mp3,"Hey Dr. Smith, so i just got finished seeing um Mrs Leslie Palmer. She is a 62 year old female with a past medical history of sarcoidosis and hypertension who presents to the emergency department today due to worsening fatigue, um shortness of breath, and palpitations. She said that this has been going on for the past 2 months. Initially called her PCP 3 days ago because her symptoms were worsening. They did some labs and um she said her symptoms got so bad today that she called her PCP again and he referred her to the emergency department. She also reports associated weight gain of approximately 8 pounds over the past 2 weeks, some wheezing, um and some other symptoms such as um lower extremity swelling bilaterally, some light headiness, some orthopnea which requires for her to sit in a recliner when she goes to sleep at night, um and a few episodes of near syncope which she has described as not fully passing out but getting close to it um and light headiness as well. Um she has a past medical history as I said of hypertension and sarcoidosis and she said she recently had a um cardiac catheterization a few years ago because of a concerning EKG which came back normal. She has um past family history which is concerning for her mother who suddenly died at age of 40 um and her father died at 59 years old of a heart attack. She is currently taking Lisinopril 10 mg once a day and Prednisone of 20 mg uh 20 mg once a day. She has no known drug allergies um she lives a pretty healthy lifestyle. She's uh active, walks about 5 days a week, 45 minutes and her diet is balanced and she has no uh alcohol, drugs, or tobacco use that She has um talked about. She currently works as an elementary school teacher and uh she is married to her husband who she lives with. Um I mentioned all of her pertinent review of systems, everything else was negative. As for her vital signs, she was tachycardic to 110, she was um not hypoxic but she was borderline with an SPO2 of 91 percent, um she had a respiratory rate of 20 making her tachypneic, and then she was mildly hypertensive at 136 over 99, um and afebrile. As per her vitals, as per her physical exam, she had uh JVD as well as 1 plus pitting edema, wheezing, and rales, but everything else was negative. For her labs, she had a negative troponin, she had a negative CBC and CMP, but she did have a bumped BNP at 4000. We also took a look at her EKG which showed um kind of borderline tachycardia and was right around 100, which she also had nonsustained SVT which was concerning. As for her echo, she had increased thickening with an EF of 55 percent and it showed a restrictive cardiomyopathy which is concerning for sarcoidosis. Um her chest xray showed sarcoid nodules and what I thought to be borderline cardiomegaly. Um as for the labs that I think we should go ahead and order, I think we should order another CMP and I think the plan is to admit her to telemetry with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. Um I think the plan should be too continue her on Lisinopril but add Amiodarone as well as um adding Lasix for her volume overload in her lower extremities as well as um I think we should increase her Prednisone to 60 mg per day instead of the 20 mg per day. I also think we should consult interventional cardiology for a possible AICD as well as uh nuclear medicine or radiology for a uh FDG PET scan. Um I think we should place her on uh assistance with getting out of bed, uh vitals Q 2 s, um or every 2 hours and um yeah I mentioned getting a lab CBC, CMP, um I don't think any other imaging is necessary except for that um PET scan. Alright thank you. ",,
Student 064,.mp3,Student 064.mp3,"And today I saw 62 year old male, Leslie Palmer, who came to the office today with a 2 week history of fatigue and shortness of breath. He stated noticing these um during exercise he said um the shortness of breath came on during some exercise exercise and that resting made him feel better as well as laying down helped him feel better. His vitals when I came in today, he had a temperature of 98.6, a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, respiratory rate of 16, and O2 stats of 96 percent. While gathering his history on him, I realized he had a past medical history of hypertension, no surgical history, his mother died of sudden cardiac death when she was about 40 years old and his dad er dad died at 59 years old of a heart attack. For the medication that he was on for his hypertension, was Lisinopril and any unknown history of any allergies. After gathering more information on his social history, he described his diet as being balanced, he exercised once a day before he started experiencing these shortness of breath symptoms, he had no history of any drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He consumes one cup of coffee a day, he is a school teacher, 5th grade, he is insured, he has a great support system. Um he lives with his wife and his immunizations are up to date. After that, I continued on with his review of systems, in which he described feeling fatigued, having chest palpitations, feeling like he was going to pass out, having dyspnea, and wheezing, as well as feeling dizzy. Upon presentation, patient seemed to be awake, alert, oriented, and fatigued. From there, I continued on with physical exam in which I found no um JVD or carotid bruits. He had a regular heart rate with a systolic murmur with an S4 sound. He had no chest wall tenderness and his PMI was displaced laterally. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and he had no edema or swelling in his lower extremities. His pulses were equal and bilateral and his calves were non tender. After looking through his results, um his xrays showed um cardiomegaly, his echo had some asymmetric um hypertrophy of the interventricular septum with an ejection fraction of 60 percent. His EKG had a normal sinus sinus rhythm with tall R waves in the septal waves and um left ventricular hypertrophy. His troponin and BNP were both within normal range. So I came up with the diagnosis of familiar familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to his past history with his mom and his dad both having cardiac issues. Um I determined him to be a new york heart association class 2 um with limitations in sun some activity. I would like to admit him to telemetry and stop his Lisinopril. Start him on Dysopyramide and we would like to consult interventional cardiology to see if they would like to place an AICD device as well as consult cardiac thoracic surgery to see um if he would be a good candidate for an alcohol injection or septal myectomy. As far as his nursings, I would like his vitals to be done every 2 hours, his activity can be as tolerated, I want him on strict input outputs, daily weight, O2 nasal cannula for about 2 liters per minute and I would like to maintain his oxygen stats above 96 percent as well as DVT prophylactin prophylaxis. Patient um was feeling okay about his diagnosis and felt like he was in good hands and his wife was fine to come  up with him and they were gonna get ready for him to be admitted. Thank you. ",,
Student 065,.mp3,Student 065.mp3,"Mr Palmer is a 62 year old male that presented to us today with a chief complaint of fatigue and uh palpitations that has been going on for the past 2 weeks. Um as far as his um history goes um the only additional thing is that he has also been experiencing experiencing near syncope with the with the um palpitations and fatigue. He says that this is this only occurs as he um uh performing activity like his his walks that he takes everyday. His only past medical history that is pertinent is the history of hypertension, however he does have a history of sudden death in the family. His mother died at 40 um of unknown cause. Dad died of a MI 59. Uh only medication that he is taking is 10 mg of Lisinopril PO uh daily. No allergies uh and no substance use. He does drink one cup of coffee a day. In addition to that um, as far as his activity, its its great. He says that he hikes almost 3 to 4 miles daily with a group of friends um and this issue has been keeping him from doing that. Um as far as physical exam goes, uh he uh did not have any JVD or peripheral edema but he did have a systolic murmur um with S4 um and a laterally displaced PMI. Uh overall this patients major presenting problem is fatigue um a differential diagnosis includes concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, sarcoidosis, myocarditis, and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I think given this patients uh family history and uh his immediate past medical history, as well as the tests that we ordered um the echo, the EKG, uh the chest xray uh and the uh lab work are all um are all in line with with HOCM being the leading diagnosis. As far as a plan for this patient, I think that um we should start him on um uh Dysopyramide, discontinue his Lisinopril, and consult interventional cardiology for defibrillator placement and cardiothoracic surgery for either myectomy or a septal myectomy or an alcohol ablation.

Uh important family history his mother did die suddenly at the age of 40 uh from unknown causes and his father died from an MI at the age of 59. In terms of his social history, he has a balanced diet, he likes to regularly exercise before his symptoms started where he went on regular walks with friends. Um he has a cup of coffee about every morning and he has been happily married for his to his wife for about 30 years and they live together. Currently he is also still working as an elementary school teacher so in terms of his presentation like I said he presented with shortness of breath. He reported fatigue and wheezing and dyspnea. Uh he was experiencing palpitations and presyncope, however, he did not present with orthopnea. Um his vitals were pretty good. The only thing was that he was a little tachycardic um at 110, but his temperature and his O2 stats uh and everything seemed uh were also within normal range. In terms of his physical exam, uh no JVD, no bruits or anything like that. He had a regular heart rate. He did appear with a systolic murmur with an S4 and a gallop. His PMI was displaced laterally suggesting that he had cardiomegaly which became apparent when we looked at his chest xrays. His lungs were clear to auscultation so nothing to worry about there. No edema, full pulses, calf wasn't tender so that falls in line with no um edema as stated before. When looking at his lab work, his troponin and BNP was perfectly fine.

I recommended that we discontinue his Lisinopril and started him on Dysopyramide 100 mg instead that way we can monitor for any um arrythmias or any other kind of problems in case that happens. I recommended a consult with interventional cardiology to look at the placement of an AICD as well as a consult to cardiothoracic surgery for um a septal myectomy or an alcohol ejection for him so thank you.

The EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block, uh troponin was elevated, BNP was over 4000. Um overall the final diagnosis and assessment was ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Um she was continued on um she was continued on Clopidogrel Clopidogrel and Warfarin uh as well as added Dobutamine because she was hypotensive because we continued your Clopidogrel and her Warfarin we would we need to do a PT and PTT INR um as well as a consultation with the interventional cardiologist for an AICD placement and a CRTD placement. She will be admitted to the ICU with a new york heart association classification of 4. Given that she is on strict bed rest and serious condition, vitals every 2 hours, strict IO, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, as well as keeping the vein open for IV access.

He said that it started about 6 months ago, but has been um increasing and then over the last 3 days, it has become significantly worse. Um he does he declined any um he denied any pain um and said he has been sleeping in his chair, his recliner, and not for relief. Um um he said that he does have symptoms at rest and that nothing has been making it better so I would say he was um he's on the NYHA scale as a 4 but symptoms at rest. Um he has a significant past medical history um for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and um paroxysmal afib. His medications include um Metoprolol succinate 50 mg, Lisinopril 10 mg, Atorvastatin 10 mg, Metformin 500 mg, Furosemide 20 mg, um Clopidogrel 75 mg, and Warfarin 2 and a half milligrams. His surgical history includes a cabbage 12 years ago and then he also um has had 5 stents put in um over the past 5 years with the last one being a year ago. cardiology told him that he was no longer a candidate for anymore um so that was the last one he had. He has no known  drug allergies um social history is significant for a 30 year history of smoking, one pack per day and um caffeine positive, he's married. Denies any alcohol or drugs. Um he is an elementary school teacher second grade. Um um family history some notable things his mother died of breast cancer about 5 years ago at the age of 80. Um his father is still living but he is in a memory unit with Alzheimer's disease. Um on review of systems, some signi significant findings was that he was um very fatigued, he has had a weight gain of around 8 pounds over the past 2 weeks. Um he did have lower limb edema um he had wheezing, he had dyspnea, and then he um was positive for orthopnea. Um on physical exam, his vital signs were as as um follows, his heart rate was 90, O2 sats on room air was 86 percent, BP was 80 over 50, temp was 98.6, and his respiration rate were 22. So um we were keeping uh s uh specially a close eye on the O2 O2 stat and the um his blood pressure. Um on actual physical exam, he did have pos, he did um test positive for JVd, um no carotid bruits were heard, um he was tachycardic with a split S2 on auscultation, his um PMI was displaced laterally, um he did he denied any chest tenderness but he did have the presence of wheezing and um bilateral ra rales on auscultation. Um going down his legs, he did have one plus pitting edema um and all pulses are peripheral peripheral pulses were good and equal. Um on his lab result, it showed that he did have an elevated troponin of 0.04 and his BNP was very elevated at um 4000. Um chest xray was significant for cardiomegaly and also um showed signs of pulmonary edema. Uh his 2D echo showed that he did have dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30 so very reduced. Um EKG um did have a normal sinus rhythm. There it looked to me like maybe some afib on the bottom which he did say he was diagnosed with and a um left bundle branch block. Um there was also on the EKG um criteria that met for left ventricular hypertrophy. So after I went over this with him, and talked to him uh stated that I though believe that he had um ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy um and that we were going to admit him to the ICU. Um his condition would be serious, he would be on strict bed rest, um some orders for the the nursing staff was to have strict ins and outs, daily weight, and uh DVT prophylaxis. Um for his oxygen, did order a Bipap um 16 6 of FIO2 of 55 percent to try to get his oxygen back up. Um we are going to keep him on a low sodium diet. Um IV fluids we none were indicated at the time so we were just going to keep him KVO. Um the meds were actually put on hold on everything except the um Clopidogrel 75 milligrams and his Warfarin 2 and a half milligrams but we are going to add Dobutamine IV drip and then have him on the insulin sliding scale. Um labs we are going to repeat the troponins to make sure they don't continue to go up so we are going to do serial troponins and then we are also going to keep an eye on his his um PT PTT INR to make sure that his blood isn't getting too thick and then for consults I told him that he would be meeting with the interventional radio uh cardiologist for um they would discuss possible implanting devices so the CRTD and the AICD um to help with dysrhythmias and to help his heart um do better. So um some lifestyle modifications that um I didn't mention with him was that we can promote a healthy diet, we can talk to him about smoking cessation, and um i think just maintaining those things would be beneficial um so yeah i think that he will do well if we get him in and get him taken care of. Get a couple of maybe devices in to help with his heart um if we keep his afib under control and um maintain his other comorbidities i think that he will do well. So thank you. ",5:08,

Student 077,.mp3,Student 077.mp3,"Good morning. My patient today is, uh was a 62, I believe, year old male. And um he came in complaining of tiredness and shortness of breath. And the first time he had um felt these symptoms was about two weeks before, while on a walk with friends and regular exercise. And these walks with friends is um a normal part of his lifestyle. And uh so he experienced that shortness of breath and tiredness precipitated by that walking exercise. And it continued to worsen every time he exercised, every time he went on a walk. So he visited his primary care provider, his family medicine doctor, about three days before presenting here at the emergency room. And um the family practice doctor ran several tests, ran an EKG, um everything came back negative. So he referred uh the patient to us at the ER. And as I mentioned, this patient, any activity that's ordinary physical activity, so exercise, resulted in this fatigue and shortness of breath. And when I'm going over his review of symptoms, um general, beyond the fatigue, excuse me, came back negative as well as the skin, the HEENT, and the musculoskeletal, but in the looking over cardio, in addition to the breathlessness, he also had palpitations and has nearly passed out several times, but has never fully passed out. So he experienced syncope there, or presyncope there, if I may correct myself. And he also experienced wheezing and dyspnea in his pulmonary. Um when going over his family history, uh the most pertinent information was he had a mother mother who suddenly died at the age of 40 with uh no medical explanation ever given, and a father who died of a heart attack at the age of 55. Um he has hypertension, and his past surgery surgical history was the cardiac cath that I believe he might have received at his family practice visit. Um but no, beyond that, healthy. Um he's on Lisinopril 10 milligrams for that hypertension. So when I went over my physical exam, um generally um I I when listening to his heart and lungs, uh several things came up mainly that being the palpitations, um there was a murmur present. Uh there was also a displaced point of mat maximal impulse laterally, and I heard that wheezing when listening to the lungs. but the lower extremity, osteopathic, um everything else about the physical exam came back normal. And when we got his labs back, everything was negative, um including troponin and um a denaturated peptide. His chest x-ray came back showing no pulmonary edema, but cardiomegaly. There's a large increased silhouette present and his echo came back with left ventricle asymmetric injection fraction of 60%. And in his EKG, there was clear tall R waves in the septal leads, normal sinus rhythm, and it fit the left ventriculo ventricular hypertrophy criteria. So this patient is diagnosed with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, um a NYHA 2 classification, and this is secondary to his hypertension. So I admitted him to tele telemetry uhh his condition is serious. I ordered vitals to be taken every two hours. Um he has no known drug allergies, activity as tolerated. Um for his nursing instructions, uh strict input output, uh taking daily weight, TPT prophylaxis, O2 via a nasal cannula, and maintaining oxygen above 96 percent. Uh he could be put on a regular diet. I also ordered IV fluids via saline lock, um and importantly for medications, to discontinue his Lisinopril but initiate uh  Dysopyramide 100 milligrams uh QID.  Um no, I didn't order any diagnostics or imaging, but I did refer him to interventional cardiology for AICD placement. And I also referred him to cardi cardiothoracic surgery for a possible uh future septal myomectomy or alcohol injection to reduce that uh left ventricular obstruction. And his vitals, if I forgot to mention, were um 110 heart rate, um 96% oxygen, 130 over 90 and for um blood pressure, and 98.6 temperature. Thank you.",,

Mr. Palmer is a 62 year old male that comes in complaining of these symptoms beginning about six months ago, progressively getting worse, especially within the last three days. Um he does not have any chest pain. However, at this point too, he must sleep in a recliner because he cannot um he cannot get down or lay down without having shortness of breath symptoms. Um overall, this limits his life to about a 10 out of 10. Past surgical history includes triple bypass surgery and five stents being placed. Overall, both surgeries were successful. He does have a support system at home in which he is married to his wife of 30 years. He works as a um elementary school teacher. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Overall, he has a good diet. In terms of exercise, he used to go on walks and no longer can due to the symptomology presence. Um the medications he's on is atorvastatin 10 milligrams, lisinopril 10 milligrams, clopidogrel 75, metformin 500 bi daily, furosemide 20 bi daily, warfarin 2.5 bi daily, and then metoprolol succinate 50. In terms of review of systems, he said that he did have weight gain of about eight pounds within the last couple of weeks, does complain of fatigue, has lower extremity edema, does have wheezing present, dyspnea, orthopnea, no heart palpitations though, and no chest pain associated. The patient overall seems like he's awake, alert oriented, but fatigued again. In terms of vital signs, his temp was 98.6, heart rate was 90, respiratory rate was 22, blood pressure, he was a bit hypotensive at 80 over 50, and his SpO2 was 86%. Upon physical exam findings, there were no carotid bruits. However, JVD was present. The patient was tachycardic. A murmur that was an S2 split was heard upon physical exam. PMI was displaced laterally to, um there were bibasilar rales associated in the lungs um based on labs that were found, the troponin was high at 0.04 and the BNP was about 4,000, indicating that um there was pulmonary edema associated and that the heart tissue was breaking down. Uh a left ventricular end diastolic volume was less than 30%. And also upon EKG rating, this patient did have a left bundle branch block. Overall, the patient did have a NYHA of a class four because any time that he got up from a resting position, he ended up having symptomology. Overall, the plan for this patient is to admit them to the ICU, um get vitals every two hours, uh start being only in bed rest for nursing interventions. Daily in and out should be taken, daily weights as well, DVT prophylaxis. They should be on a strict low Na+ diet that also corresponds with their diabetes diet as well. They need to keep their vein open, so KVO. In terms of medications, which of all the ones that they were on, they need to stop them, except for the Clopidogrel 75 milligrams, and the Warfarin 2.5 uh two times daily, because we do not want to throw a clot. We are also going to add dobutamine, IV drip, and an insulin sliding scale to its diabetes. Dobutamine will be used to allow for better contraction of the heart, since there was that pulmonary edema. Um lets see, so in terms of labs that need to be um found or keep taken, we need to get serial troponins taken, taken,  to see if that heart tissue is breaking down more. And also we need to get an INR because of uh warfarin. And a consult for cardiologists was discussed with the patient. And this hopefully will be able to help them either be on a CRTD or an AICD placement. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.",,

For means of respiratory therapy, he'll be put on BiPAP at 16 over 6 with an FiO2 of 50%. For repeat diagnostic labs and um and procedures what will be completed is only a serial troponin to see if that corrects with treatment. Um interventional cardiology will be consulted for possible uh AICD placement and possible um CRKD um placement as well. And he will be basically be advised of maintaining a healthy weight, um weight reduction, keeping away from strenuous physical activity, and he will also be advised to stop smoking cigarettes if possible. Alright.",,
Student 084,.mp3,Student 084.mp3,"I just got finished seeing patient Leslie Palmer. She prefers to go by Miss Palmer. She came in with a chief complaint of fatigue and shortness of breath. It started about two months ago. She's also having syncope, palpitations, dyspnea, orthopnea, and she also had an eight pound weight gain um in her legs, mainly from the edema that she's experiencing. Um It's worse with physical activities. So she's an NYHA class three, but better with rest. She is sleeping in her recliner due to the fact that um she is having orthopnea, not being able to breathe while she's laying down. Um she did have a cardiac catheterization 25 years ago, but they didn't find anything. Um her father died when he was 59 years old from myocardial infarction and her mom at 40 from sudden death without known cause. She has not been hospitalized other than the cath. Um in terms of her medical condition, she has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis, for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and prednisone 10 milligrams daily, um but she has no known drug allergies. In terms of her diet, she eats a balanced diet. She exercises daily, except she hasn't been able to for at least the past two months because of all of her current symptoms. Um she also does not use drugs, no tobacco, no alcohol, but does drink a cup of coffee daily. She's an elementary school teacher who's been married for 30 years and has a good support system with her spouse who she lives with. Um in terms of her vital signs, her temperature looked good. Her heart rate was elevated at 110, respirations were 22. Her blood pressure was 136 over 99 and her oxygen stats were 91%. Um so with that, I went ahead and admitted her um into telemetry and diagnosed her with sarcoidosis restrictive  um cardiomyopathy, a serious condition um where the nurse, I ordered for the nurses to check every two hours and um she could only come out of bed with assistance. Um in terms of instructions, strict I and O's, daily weights, uh nasal cannula, and also maintaining 96% and also DVT prophylaxis with a low sodium diet, KVO. Um in terms of her medications, I'm continuing lisinopril because her blood pressure is still elevated. In terms of her prednisone, I am increasing the dose to 60 milligrams since it's an acute exasperation. I also added on IV furosemide to help get rid of some of the edema. Um and also I added on um amiodarone since I noticed that she was having uh a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on her EKG. In terms of lab work, I went ahead and ordered a CMP just since I put her on furosemide. And I've gone ahead and made consultations with an interventional cardiologist to come and look about AICD placement, as well as a radiologist, a nuclear radiologist for the FDG PET scan.

Ms. Palmers is a 62 year old female presenting with the chief complaint of orthopnea and fatigue that started two months ago but has gotten worse the past three days. She has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams and prednisone 10 milligrams for. She has no allergies. She has gained eight pounds in the past two weeks, has dyspnea, palpitations, and sometimes has feelings of presyncope. She also mentioned swelling in her ankle. She had a cardiac catheter put in one year ago. Regarding her social history, she has a balanced diet, no alcohol, illicit drug, or tobacco use. She drinks one cup of coffee a day. She is currently sexually active and lives with her husband. She is generally active and walks with her friends regularly, but she has not been able to do that recently. Currently she is NYHA uh  class 3 with marked limitations of physical activity. Regarding her family, her mother is deceased and passed away from sudden death and her father died at 59 due to myocardial infarction. Now in regards to her vitals, temperature was 98.6, heart rate was 110, respiratory rate was 20, pulse was 108, blood pressure was 136 over 99, and oxygen level was 91%. Cardiopulmonary physical exam showed positive JVD, no carotid bruit, regular heart rate, murmur, presence of gallop, presence of murmur, rails, and wheezing. She had pedal edema, and DP PT pulses were full/equal. her pulses were her labs were elevated BNP at 4,000. X ray showed normal heart size pulmonary edema and mediastinal fullness. ECHO showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness with an ejection fraction at 55%. And EKG showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Homann's sign testing for DVT was negative. So at this point, sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy was suspected. So I spoke to her about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about her social support and insurance. At this time, she will be admitted to telemetry. Vitals will be taken every two hours and activity instructions are out of bed with assistance. Nursing intervention includes strict I-O, daily weight, O2 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula, DVT prophylaxis, and maintaining her oxygen saturation about 96%. Diet is low, sodium and KVO for fluid IVs. Medication will include prednisone 60 milligrams PO. She will continue taking her lisinopril of 10 milligrams PO and we will add furosemide 40 mg via IV every 12 hours.

She notes that the fatigue and shortness of breath is much worse upon any type of exertion or just regular moving around. Is also she also notes some orthopnea that is improved when she sits up and she actually prefers to sit in her recliner. Um patient notes that approximately 2 and 1⁄2 weeks ago, she had a cold, runny nose, fever, and some shortness of breath with a cough, um and uh also some fatigue. A patient has no significant history other than hypertension. Her surgical procedural history, she had a cardiac cath last year. Family history, her mom died of breast cancer, her dad is living with Alzheimer's. Social, she eats a balanced diet, she exercises two times a week, but ever since these symptoms began she has not been able to exercise without significant shortness of breath. She does not use drugs, tobacco, alcohol. She does drink a cup of coffee every day and she lives with her husband right now. Medications. She takes lisinopril 10 milligrams for the hypertension and she has no known allergies. A review of symptoms, besides the fatigue, um she denied today any fever, chills, uh weight loss or weight gain. Um she had no rashes, skin discoloration, lesions, or bruising. Musculoskeletal, patient noted some leg swelling but denied any muscle aches, joint pain, back pain. Um cardiovascular, she did have, she noted some chest pain and some palpitations, but denies any syncopal episodes. Um she  pulmonary, she did have some orthopnea and she noted some wheezing and obviously she had the dyspnea. Neuro, patient had no complaints. She denied up gait disturbances, dizziness, or confusion. HEENT, she denied any neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, vision changes, hearing loss. And then upon presentation today, her vital sign, her blood pressure was 130 over 90, temperature 98.6. Uh she was tachycardic at 110 and her O2 set was 91. Upon physical exam, she had jugular vein distension, cardio vascularly regular, no murmurs, no friction rub, no gallops. She did have a displaced PMI laterally. Lungs, onto auscultation, I noted bibasilar rails and wheezing, MSK 1 plus pitting edema bilaterally in Neurological exam was normal. So today we ordered troponin, BMP, EKG, chest x-ray, echo. Troponin was 0.1, which is mildly elevated. BMP was elevated at 4,000. EKG, she was sinus tachycardic at 100. There was a right bundle branch block, RSR, in the right leads. She had left axis deviation and premature ventricular contractions in AVR, AVL, AVF. On chest x-ray, there was pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed a dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction, less than 30%. So I discussed this lab work and the imaging with the patient. I diagnosed her with myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and I discussed that it's probably related to the viral illness she had a few weeks ago. So we're going to admit her to telemetry. She's gonna see interventional radiology for AICD placement and CRT. They might even wanna do an endomyocardial biopsy. We'll also consult with infectious disease for immunoglobulin glucocorticoids, as well as radiology for contrast MRI. So we're going to keep around lisinopril, add acetaminophen for the pain, and we're going to get her on a furosemide 40 milligrams IV to get that fluid off. And then I discussed all the findings, I discussed the plan with the patient. We discussed the cause of the uh myocarditis um and I discussed the treatment options for her and told her that she's gonna be in great hands.",,
Student 088,.mp3,Student 088.mp3,"Mr. Palmer walked into the ED today with a chief complaint of chest palpitations and difficulties when exercising. Mr. Palmer is currently being treated for hypertension with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, and his symptoms were onset during a bout of exercise. And Mr. Palmer states that he has no trouble when lying down, uh no trouble breathing when lying down. Some background history on Mr. Palmer is that he um tries to walk every day until his symptoms um and he has a balanced diet. He drinks one cup of coffee a day. And some relevant past family medical history include a myocardial infarction on his father's side and a sudden death from his uh mother who died at a premature age of 40. And Mr. Palmer had mentioned that he had initially gone to his PCP to get some work done and that his PCP told him to come to the ED to have his symptoms further evaluated. He has been hospitalized in the past for a cath procedure which came back okay as he stated and as he also had an EKG at that time. And Mr. Palmer presented tired, fatigued, and weak but he had no chest pain, only the palpitations. And he said that he almost had felt like as if he was gonna faint sometimes, leading me to think it was presyncope. And in addition to that, during the review of systems, relevant findings on the pulmonary side included dyspnea. And during the physical exam, there was no pedal edema noted or pitting. And his PMI was displaced laterally. And during counseling, I went over all of his labs and his labs included an x-ray showing cardiomegaly and a 2D echo showing septal growth in the myocardium of the heart and an EKG indicating um familial cardio- familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the growth in the septal waves. And for treatment, I counseled Mr. Palmer on discontinuing his lisinopril and I think it's best to plan and administer a dosage of disopyramide for him to help with his palpitations. And I would like to admit Mr. Palmer to telemetry for monitoring and ultimately have him consulted by interventional cardiology in order to get an AICD placed and cardiothoracic surgery to consult him on a potential septal myectomy and um alcohol alcohol injection and that essentially it concludes my notes on this patient encounter today and relevant vitals Encounter included an elevated heart rate and an elevated blood pressure as well.

Her echoes showed uh enlarged left ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction. Her KEG her EKG showed left axis, she had tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and also showed a right bundle branch block. So for her diagnosis, I went ahead and diagnosed her with myocarditis dilated myocarditis um I told her that the condition was serious and that we're going to admit her to telemetry. We are going to continue her on lisinopril, um put her on furosemide, and then acetaminophen for her chest pain. Um she, we're going to consult cardiology, interventional cardiology.

Student 095,.mp3,Student 095.mp3,"So, Mrs. Palmer is a 62-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension on 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily, and she's presenting to the emergency department today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. She states that two weeks ago, she had a cough, a fever, and a runny nose, along with her current symptoms, and she says that those all subsided about five days ago, but the ones that are currently presenting are still persisting through. Her chest pain is described as being substernal, constant, and dull, and it doesn't radiate anywhere else. Um nothing seems to specifically aggravate it, but she has also not tried any medications, but she does note that reclining back makes her symptoms a little better. Um h er current pain level is a 2 out of 10, and she feels that her chest pain is at rest, which would classify her as an NYHA of four. Her only surgical history is a cardiac catheterization about a year ago that showed no obstructive coronary artery disease, and she has no known drug allergies. She doesn't smoke, drink, or do any illicit substances at all. She works as an elementary school teacher, and her family history is positive for a mom who passed away from breast cancer at the age of 80. And her current father is 89, and he's in the nursing home for Alzheimer's right now. She states she eats a well-balanced diet, and she was exercising two times a week for about an hour at a time, but she hasn't been able to given her current symptoms. She drinks a cup of coffee a day, and she's currently married and lives in a stable household with her husband of 30 years, and she's still sexually active with just her husband and only her husband. Her vitals at the consultation were a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. Her respiratory rate was a 20, and her temperature was at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. On the review of systems, she was positive for fatigue and recent weight gain of eight pounds. She noted palpitations and chest pain with no syncope. Um she also noted wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, and some lower extremity edema. Um her physical exam showed jugular vein distension with no carotid bruits. Her heart rate was regular with no murmur, friction rubs, or any gallops. On palpitation of her PMI, it was noted to be laterally displaced, and her lungs were positive for bibasilar rails and wheezing. She also had 1 plus pitting edema in her lower extremity, but she also had a negative Homann sign, and pulses were full and equal bilaterally as well. On the imaging that was done upon entering the ER today, her chest x-ray showed that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Her echo was interpreted by the radiologist and was found to have a dilated left ventricle, an ejection fraction of 30%. Um her EKG showed that she had sinus tachycardia with about 100 beats per minute on that and a right bundle branch block. And there were also a few captured preventricular contractions as well. Her lab showed a troponin of 0.1 and a BNP of 4,000. And given all her history, physical exam, and diagnostic exams that were done, a diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy was made. The treatment plan for Mrs. Palmer was to admit her to telemetry, take vitals every 2 hours and have the nurses monitor her ins and outs, daily weights, DVT, prophylaxis, and bring her oxygen up with an O2 nasal cannula, trying to get her sats over 96%. Um we should keep her on a diet low in sodium and have her restricted on oral fluid intake. She will also be on an IV fluid saline lock, KVO. She was instructed to continue taking her lisinopril while in the hospital and thereafter, and we'll also add on some acetaminophen, 625, every six hours by mouth, and furosemide, 40 milligrams IV, and also a beta-blocker, metoprolol succinate, 50 milligrams by mouth while she's in the hospital. Additionally, we're gonna get repeat labs with serial troponins and a 2D echo during her stay here. We also have consulted interventional cardiology for a CRTD and potential AICD placement, and also a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted as well, just for potential immunoglobulin and glucocorticoid treatment if they deem it necessary. And then lastly, the radiologist was consulted for a potential media-enhanced MRI if they also deem that necessary. Overall, Mrs. Palmer expressed no concerns with being admitted to the hospital or to the treatment plan moving forward.",,
Student 096,.mp3,Student 096.mp3,"Today I'm presenting patient Ms. Palmer, who is a pleasant but somewhat fatigued appearing 62-year-old female patient with a chief complaint of fatigue, shortness of breath, and dull chest pain which began about two weeks ago. She states she just had some fever, cough, and runny nose when her symptoms began and believed that she just had a cold. She continued to exercise, believing she just had the common cold, but noticed she was unable to complete her exercises due to shortness of breath and fatigue, which was unusual for her. Ms. Palmer states her symptoms have been constant since her onset and nothing has made it better, but notices that exercise can make it worse. She has tried nothing medically for her symptoms and rates their severity as a 2 out of 10 today. Regarding her medical history, she did have a cardiac cath about a year ago and does have a history of hypertension. She has no allergies. She exercises about 2-3 times a week before her symptoms began and was unable to do so since. She does not use any drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. She does drink about one cup of coffee per day. She currently does work as an elementary school teacher and lives comfortably at home with her husband. She has no prior history of hospitalizations. She mentions no family history when inquired. She is currently taking Lisinopril, 10 milligrams peri-orally daily for her hypertension. Her general review of systems revealed no fever or chills today, although they did occur two weeks ago when her symptoms began. She does have fatigue today as well as an 8 pound weight gain. Her skin ROS is negative. Her head, eye, ears, nose, and throat ROS is also negative. Her cardio ROS reveals some dull chest pain today accompanied by palpitations but no presyncope. Pulmonary ROS does have shortness of breath, wheezing, and has been sleeping on a recliner due to her orthopnea. Her MSK ROS reveals some mild muscle aches in her lower legs as well as noticeable swelling in her lower extremities. Her neuro ROS is negative. She is otherwise well-developed and well-nourished, albeit with some fatigue and is alert and oriented today. She is not in any pain when asked. A thorough physical examination was performed and notably there was some JVD in her neck area. She also did have some bilateral rails and wheezing on auscultation of the lungs. However, regarding a cardiac examination, she revealed no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, but did have a laterally displaced PMI. Her lower extremity did reveal 1 plus pitting edema. However, the calves were symmetric and negative Homann's sign and eluded no concern for PE at this time. Her abdomen was also soft and non-tender and there were no TART changes noticed. Her vitals were normal except for a mild tachycardia of 110 and her respiratory rate of 20, a blood pressure of 130 over 90, and O2 sat of 91 today. Her labs including chest x-ray which reveals some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, her EKG which reveals some right bundle branch block and sinus tachycardia and her 2D echo, which revealed 30% ejection fracture and dilated cardiomyopathy. Her blood work revealed troponin slightly elevated and BMP of 4,000 and slightly elevated. This will be reviewed with the patient and a primary diagnosis of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class two was made given her presentation. We plan to admit her to med with telemetry. Her condition is currently serious. Vitals are to be taken every two hours and her activity levels can be managed as tolerated. Nursing was instructed to manage strict input-output, daily weight changes, DVT prophylaxis, as well as O2 via nasal cannula, and her O2 saturation is to be maintained above 96%. She is also recommended to have a low-sodium diet, and perioral fluid restriction is recommended at this time. IV fluids are to be locked, and the veins are to be kept open. She has no allergies. Acetaminophen 625 milligrams peri-orally every six hours is recommended to help with her inflammation and she is to continue her lisinopril as previously prescribed of 10 milligrams every day. We are to add furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 12 hours to help reduce the swelling. We will repeat serial troponin and get a CMP as she is now on furosemide. She was referred to interventional cardiology for AICD placement as well as CRTD and a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Infectious disease was also consulted for referral for immune globulin as well as glucocorticoids to further reduce the swelling. Radiology consult for contrast media enhanced MRI was also recommended to detect for further myocardial inflammation. She was recommended to maintain a healthy weight and to reduce her weight, and no strenuous physical activity is to be recommended at this time. Patient had no further questions and was satisfied with her diagnosis and treatment plan.",,
Student 097,.mp3,Student 097.mp3,"Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male in room 2. He arrived at the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue, just constant fatigue. Um he said these symptoms gradually got worse over the past six months. Um and he made an appointment with his primary care physician about three days ago, and the physicians recommended him to check himself in at the emergency room. He did not complain of any chest pain. He did mention that his legs have been swollen, likely due to lower extremity edema. Mr. Palmer also said that he gained about eight pounds recently, and that he's been getting wheezes and shortness of breath while sleeping. He has a past medical history of um uh  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type two diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He's also had um triple bypass and a uh lower sorry lower left ascending artery stent put in about a year ago. Uh Mr Plamer has no pertinent family uh history related to his present illness. Mr. Palmer used to walk with his friends often, but now due to his fatigue over the last six months, he's been unable to walk at all. He does smoke one pack a day, and I have talked to him about quitting smoking, and he has interest in seeking help. And I was gonna refer him to a specialist who can help with that, help him quit. As of right now, he's currently taking the following medications. He's taking Warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, uh furosemide, and uh metoprolol succinate. And he has no known drug allergies. His vital signs are as follows. His blood pressure is 80 over 50, which is a little hypertensive. Temperature is normal at 98.6. His SpO2 is 86, which is also low. And his heart rate is normal at 90 beats per minute. Upon physical exam, Mr. Palmer had JVD, heart gallop, lung wheezes, and rails were also present. He also had pulmonary edema in his lower extremities, like he mentioned before, and uh he did not have any chest wall tenderness upon palpation. Um after the physical exam, I told him he most likely has ischemic cardiomyopathy, and as well as a secondary diagnosis of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. For admission, we'll have to admit him to the ICU upon serious conditions. We'll have to take his vitals every two hours, and he'll have to be on strict bed rest with no, little to no physical activity. The nurses will intervene with strict IOs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, as well as BiPAP. We'll put him on a low sodium diet since he has no food allergies as well. I will order troponin and PT-INR for labs. We have to make sure his IV stays open and refer him to an interventional cardiologist for a AICD. And we'll have him continue as Warfarin and Clopidogrel, but as well we'll add on an insulin sliding scale continue as Warfarin and Clopidogrel, but as well we'll add on an insulin sliding scale and WME and IV drip. Thanks so much.",,

The patient states that he began his symptoms about two weeks ago and he went to his family medicine doctor because he was a little concerned. And his family medicine doctor ordered some tests, but he did not, but the patient did not get any of his tests back. However, yesterday, the patient noticed that his, uh the patient noticed that his symptoms were worsening, so he decided to come to the ER. Upon presentation, the patient states that he has trouble with some physical activity. He has some trouble with physical activity and he also states that he, these symptoms do get better upon rest. The patient states that he, in terms of severity, he states that while he's sitting, his severity is zero, but with any brief, okay, I'm gonna start over. All right, so I'm gonna start over. Hi, Dr. Rawlins, this is student Dr. Akshata Sastry and I'll be presenting the case for Mr. Leslie Palmer who is a  62-year-old male, and he presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and near syncope. The patient states that he visited his family medicine doctor about two weeks ago, about a few days ago, concerned about his symptoms. And the PCP decided to run some tests, but the patient has not received those back yet. Uh the patient notes that he had an uh increase in symptoms yesterday, and that's why he decided to come to the ER. The patient states that his uh his symptoms began about two weeks ago. He states that they are better at rest, so he does not have any severity or any symptoms when he is at zero. However, he says that with some physical activity, he does have his symptoms do not radiate anywhere and he did not treat with any medication because he did not know any of them. Um his medical history states that he's the patient, Mr. Palmer states that he had a cardiac cath about a year ago and his medical history for hypertension. The patient states he also did not have any allergies. In terms of his social history, the patient eats a very balanced diet, and is a very active elementary school teacher. He is sexually active with his wife. Upon the ROS, the patient denies all symptoms except for his fatigue, his shortness of breath, some wheezing, and um and some palpitations, and of course, his presyncopal episodes. And I decided to start the physical exam at that point. I did not note any carotid bruise. I decided to listen to his and I did not notice any chest tenderness. When I listened to his heart, I did notice an S3, S4 murmur as well as a gallop. I listened to his lungs and uh they were clear to bilaterally to auscultation. Um i decided to also check for any abdominal bruits and abdominal masses and that was negative. He did not have any peripheral edema. He did not have any calf asymmetry, no homan signs. Yeah, and his pulses were very strong. I decided to get, look at his vitals and his vitals did look a little bit high. His heart rate was at 110 and his saturation was about 96%, which was okay. His respiration rate was about 16 breaths per minute and his blood pressure was 130 over 90. Um upon looking at his labs, I noticed his CMP, his troponin and his BNP were all normal within normal values. His chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and his ECHO showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%. And his EKG demonstrated tall R waves in all the septal Leads, some left ventricular hypertrophy, and but other than that, normal sinus rhythm and normal axis. For admission, I decided to diagnose him with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because uh he did say that his family, oh, he also told me that he, in terms of his family, his mother passed away suddenly at the age of 40 and his father passed away from a myocardial infarction. So due to his history, I decided, and along with his physical exam, I decided that he has a diagnosis. I decided that he takes for his hypertension and instead we put on a disopyramide and then I would like to admit him to the hospital to telemetry. I would like the nurses to be watching it for ins and outs, DVT prophylaxis. I would like to have his daily weight watched and I'd like to put him on a nasal cannula at two liters and keep them above 96% because of his complaint on shortness of breath. In terms of people I would like to, the doctors I'd like to consult with him, I would like an interventional cardiologist to come see him for his AICD and I'd also like a  cardio- cardiothoracic surgeon to come see him for evaluation if he needs a septal myectomy or alcohol injection. And that is the conclusion of my case presentation. Thank you.",,
Student 099,.mp3,Student 099.mp3,"after a family med consult. Uh her family doctor ordered some tests because she was concerned about her six month duration uh dyspnea. Um the patient noted that the dyspnea gets better only when she lays in the recliner. She hasn't tried anything to make it better and nothing that she tried made it better. She rated the breathing that she would experience a 9 out of 10 on the worst exertion. As far as her medical history is concerned, she had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, she was diabetic and five years ago she was diagnosed with AFib. Uh on her father's side, uh he is in a nursing home currently, 89 years old. Her mother's side, breast cancer. Um she has no allergies to medications. She had a stent put in last June. Aside from that, she had five stents put in total and she had a triple bypass done. No hospitalizations. She had a list of medications that I inputted into the EMR. She has a balanced diet, exercises daily, doesn't take any drugs or alcohol, still smokes. I counseled the patient about quitting the smoking because she does one pack a day. She drinks one cup of coffee a day. She's currently still an elementary school teacher, and she has a partner that was sitting in the waiting room who she's married to for 30 years with no kids. As far as her vitals are concerned, um her heart rate was 90, her blood pressure was 80 over 50, respiratory rate 22, pulse 90, temperature 98.6. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left bundle branch block, and left axis deviation. Uh her lab results showed elevated troponin and BMP, indicative of cardiac muscle cell death and heart failure, or what I said to the patient was heart dysfunction um. As far as review of systems is concerned, she had orthopnea, she had difficulty breathing at rest, so that puts her at an NYHA score of She had fatigue, wheezing, every other ROS for MSK and neuro GI was negative or otherwise noted in the EMR. I didn't have a chance to copy it over onto my sheet. She is immunized or up to date on all her immunizations. I gave her a consult as far as her needing to be admitted to the ICU. The nurses will receive instructions regarding vitals to be checked every two hours, uh strict bed rest, um also strict monitoring of intake, outtake, daily weights, uh DVT prophylaxis, low-sodium diet, IV, KVO. She would need BiPAP. We would discontinue all her medications, which I let her know, and add dobutamine for her blood pressure. I didn't let the patient know that we would need to put her on an insulin scale, but I think that's more necessary to know for the nursing staff. And she would continue taking Plavix and Warfarin. She would need to get repeat labs for troponins and PT and INR because she's currently taking warfarin. Um s far as consult, I let the patient know that she would need a consult to interventional cardiology for CRT and AICD, specifically because of the left bundle branch blocking need to reestablish some normal rhythm in her left bundle branch blocking need to reestablish some normal rhythm in her heart. Um that's it.",,

Student 101,.mp3,Student 101.mp3,"left the emergency department after seeing Ms. Leslie Palmer. She is a 62-year-old female who's presenting with symptoms of progressive worsening of shortness of breath and fatigue over the last two months. She said she saw her family doctor about three days ago where she received a diagnostic workup, but did not get to review the labs and diagnostic findings with her PCP. Um she said she presents today because her symptoms have worsened. She says that she has significant decreases in her activity levels, no longer able to complete her normal activity. Um the patient has a history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she reports compliance with her medications of lisinopril and prednisone, reports a maternal history of sudden death of her mother around 40 years, and her paternal history of death at 59 following a MI. She has no known drug allergies, reports an outpatient cath procedure about one year ago, no complications from that. Her associated symptoms that she's experiencing with today is about eight pounds weight gain two weeks. Fatigue as I said. She notes some presyncope as well as palpitations, no chest pain though. Associated wheezing and orthopnea where she says she's now having to lay in her chair to sleep. Notes of edema to her ankles bilaterally. Um on my exam she was awake alert and oriented. Her vitals, she  she was a little low on her O2 stats with 91%. BP was a little elevated, 136 over 99. She was afebrile at 98.6 and was a little tachy at 110, a respiratory rate of 20. um on my exam, I didn't hear any carotid bruits. JVD was present bilaterally. I heard an S4 systolic murmur with no rubs or gallops. PMI was not displaced. Wheezes were present and rails were present. She had no tenderness, was not in acute respiratory distress though. Homan's was negative, no, non tender calves. She did have pedal edema, one plus. Her pulses were all present. I'm looking at her x-rays, she had mediastinal fullness, pulmonary edema, as well as a normal heart size. I discussed this all with the patient as well as going over her ECHO, which was read as restrictive cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction at 95 or 55 percent, excuse me. Her EKG, it seemed normal, maybe an occurrence of some left ventricular hypertrophy was a little elevated in the V5, V6 leads. I told her it could have been maybe something we want to repeat on the EKG at a later time. On the monitor though, I did note a period of non-sustained V-tachs. We talked about that as well with the patient. Her troponin, as well as her CBC and CMP were within normal limits, non-diagnostic, but she did have an elevated BNP at 4,000. So I discussed with the patient that I believe that her pulmonary sarcoidosis history, that was about 25 years ago, has likely spread to her heart and is causing her symptom presentation. Currently, I would put the patient on the plan to get admitted to telemetry and where we'll get consults for interventional cardiology as well as radiology to further um evaluate and work up this patient. She told her about potential for getting a pacemaker placed as well as to get further imaging um with the radiologist um. Went through the plans and how she'll be admitted. Um she says she has insurance and good social support locally. So she felt good about that plan to get her admitted and have people who would support her. Um we talked about how she's gonna get some medication to support her symptoms, try to help alleviate them. So I'm gonna go ahead and diagnose her with, or prescribe her some amiodarone with a non-sustaining vtach as well as lisinopril. And I'm gonna up her prednisone dosage um since the pulmonary sarcoidosis has seemingly spread to her heart. I'm also gonna get some furosemide to help the pulmonary edema that she's experiencing. Um and I'm gonna do a repeat CMP just to make sure that nothing has changed from that. just to make sure that nothing has changed from that.",,
Student 102,.mp3,Student 102.mp3,"for our patient Leslie. She is a 62-year-old female, Leslie Palmer. She came in to the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue. She stated this started about two weeks ago when she first had flu-like symptoms and they seemed to go away around five days ago, but ever since that moment, she has been quite tired and fatigued. Um especially, she said, when she goes to the gym, she's not able to do any strenuous activity. So, having some exertion with dyspnea. She also states that she seems to have a dull, constant pain on her chest and uh the only way to make it feel better, especially during the night, is to put some pillows and sit on the recliner. So it seems like she's got some orthopnea going along with the dyspnea. Then she didn't take any medications in the past uh what the only thing that makes it feel better is just resting. I do want to see, I do want to go over also her past medical history. She does seem to have a history of hypertension. She was taking lisinopril, 10 milligrams. She stated she had no allergies, but she has had some prior procedures before. She had a cardiac cath about a year ago due to some abnormal EKGs, but everything came up okay, she stated. Other pertinent history, her mom, she died of breast cancer, and her dad currently is 90 years old with dementia. And in addition to that, social factors, she usually exercises two to three days a week, so she is active and eats a balanced, well diet, so it is a little on the stranger side that she has, she's had shortness of breath while trying to exercise. She is a teacher and is married and sexually active as well. When I did the review of systems, I did get some pertinent information when it came to general. She complained of fatigue, some gain of weight. She did have a fever and chills in the past but not currently. Then skin was normal, HEENT was normal. Then in cardiac ROS, she did have palpitations and chest pain. And with lungs, she said she complained of shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea, and some wheezing as well. She did that she had fluid in her extremities. And other than that, the her vitals, they were 130 over 90, heart rate was 110, temperature was 98.6, respiration rate was 20, oxygen saturation was 91%, Uh when it comes to the physical exam itself, we have right here, let's see. She did have a jugular vein distension. In regards to cardiovascular problems, she did have her PMI was displaced laterally, uh no murmurs, friction rub, or gallops. There did seem to be some rails present as well, the wheezes, and in regards to her edema, she did have some pedal edema. She also had her pulses and her dorsalis pedis were equal bilateral. Her x-ray did show cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, which was explained to her. It did show some dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction as well. And her EKG showed some sinus tachy with left ventricular hypertrophy um and some probably a right bundle branch block. Troponin was elevated. BMP was 4,000. As a whole, she was diagnosed with myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to the prior history. And with congestive heart failure, as her New York Heart Association score, it was a three due to, I'm sorry, was it two, as she had limitation only with strenuous physical activity. She was admitted for telemetry. This is a serious case. We wanted to keep vitals every two hours. Activity as tolerated. Uh nursing interventions included daily weights, O2 spats of 96% and DVT prophylaxis, strict intake and output. We wanted to keep the vein open. In regards to medication, we are allowing for a sat of 96, 625 milligrams every six hours as needed. Then we have metoprolol and lisinopril, which were prescribed. So, lisinopril 10 milligrams every day, and then the 50 milligrams by mouth every day of metoprolol along with furosemide 40 milligrams IV every 12 hours. Additional labs included serial troponins and then also repeat 2D echo to take a look at the heart and monitor progress. She was referred to interventional cardiology, infectious diseases, and radiology for possible AICD placement, CRTD placement, endomyocardial biopsy, media-enhanced MRI, and immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids, possibly. But that will be something the specialists will be taking care of. Thank you.",,
Student 103,.mp3,Student 103.mp3,"I'm presenting to you today a 62-year-old female patient, Leslie Palmer, who showed up today to the ER with um chief complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations that started two months ago, which has been getting worse. Patient stated to have visited her family and medicine provider three days ago, but since then um her symptoms haven't gotten any better, and I would classify her as a NYHA classification of three. Um patient said that she had fatigue and gained eight pounds since the start of her symptoms. Patient also stated that she had wheezing, orthopnea and dyspnea with exertion. For her cardiovascular symptoms, uh she stated that she had palpitations, presyncope, but no chest pain. Her musculoskeletal symptoms were all negative except for swelling in her lower extremities. Otherwise, everything else was insignificant for her ROS. The patient has hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis that was diagnosed 25 years ago. The patient had a cardiac cath done a year ago with no significant results, otherwise no other hospitalizations. The patient has no known allergies . um she's not taking any illicit drugs, no tobacco or alcohol. Um she drinks a cup of coffee every day and is an elementary school teacher. She's also married and has someone to take care of her throughout her medical care, and um she has insurance. Uh her patient died suddenly at the age of 40, and her father died of a heart attack at the age of 59. Um for her physical exam, I noted a positive jugular venous distension, but no carotid bruits, no rashes, no petechiae, no purpura. Um she had bi-basilar rails and wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was normal, with no chest wall tenderness. She had a uh positive one pitting lower extremity edema and had a full and equal posterior tibial um pulses. Her calf was non-tender, her heart was regular with a systolic murmur of S4, no pericardial friction rub, um but positive for gallops. She had a heart rate of 110, up 120, blood pressure of 136 over 99, pulse was 108, and her temperature was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. For her lab, she only had elevated BMP levels, chest X-ray showed infiltration in her lungs, a widened mediastinum, and a normal-sized heart. The echo results showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 55%. Her EKG showed normal sinus and access with a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Um so so the patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy and she'll be admitted to the hospital. Patient will be continuing her lisinopril, 10 milligrams. I increased her prednisone to 60 milligrams and then I added amiodarone, 150 milligrams IV and furosemide 40 milligrams IV. Um I'll be ordering CMP labs for her and I will also be consulting interventional cardiology for an AICD placement and radiology for a FDG PET scan. Um patient will also be given oxygen via the nasal cannula to maintain her oxygen saturation above 96%. And I counseled the patient on maintaining a low sodium diet and not getting out of bed without assistance. Thank you.",,

So she went to her PCP about three days ago, complaining of shortness of breath, tiredness, fluttering in her heart, as well as some feelings of about to pass out. She didn't actually pass out, so if racing can be feelings. Her PCP told us if any, told her if anything got worse to come see us, and he also ordered her x-ray, labs, echo, and EKG. So we're going to go over those with her. I went over them with her. Sorry. 3, 2, 1, go. Hi, Dr. Rawlins. I'm a student doctor Drew McCauley. I just want to give a case presentation on the patient I just saw, Ms. Leslie. So she went to her PCP about three days ago with complaints of shortness of breath, tiredness, fluttering in her heart, as well as presyncope feelings. went ahead and ordered labs, chest x-ray, echo, and EKG, and we're going to go over those results with the patient today, which is quite good. And she came to the ED as instructed by her doctor as her symptoms were getting worse. So this all began about two months ago, and she is no longer able to do really any activity without the pain, sorry not the pain, her symptoms getting worse. She likes to sit in her recliner as well as rest to help with her symptoms. She says that it gets worse when she's laying flat as well as being moving in any sort of activity. So her past medical history consists of high blood pressure and pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed 25 years ago. She had a cardiac cath one year ago. No complications, nothing significant from that. My family medical history for her mom was sudden death at 40 and her father died of a heart attack at 59. For social history, she does not use alcohol, not use tobacco, never uses drugs, never has before. She is currently employed as a fourth grade teacher. Cup of coffee. She used to exercise regularly five times a week with a walking group of her friends but due to her symptoms she is no longer able to do that. She is living with her husband. She currently takes a lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day as well as prednisone 10 milligrams once a day for sarcoidosis, lisinopril's for her high blood pressure. She has no drug allergies. She does have an unexplained weight gain of about eight pounds over the past two weeks. Her ROS for skin and HEENT were both negative. For her cardiovascular, we talk about her palpitation she's been experiencing and she also said the feelings of presyncope like we already talked about. For pulmonary, she has them having some wheezing as well as the dyspnea and orthopnea. For MSK, she's had the lower extremity edema and she's had some light headedness feeling. Today she presented awake, alert, and oriented. Her vital signs were as follows. Temperature was 98.6, heart rate 110, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 136 over 90, SpO2 at 91%. She had no carotid bruits. She did have JVD bilaterally. She had a regular heart rate. She did have an S4 murmur when I was listening on the mitral valve and her PMI was normal. Bilaterally, she did have wheezing and rales upon auscultation of her lungs. No homan sign. For her imaging looking at her chest x-ray she had mediastinal fullness and pulmonary edema in a normal size heart. And looking at her echo they said that the diagnosis was restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness, ejection fraction 55%. Looking at her EKG, it was normal sinus rhythm, but she did have some non-sustained Vtach. Her labs were normal for troponin and elevated for BMP at 4000. So given all the information of her history, physical exam, and the imaging and labs, I diagnosed her with sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy. She had a New York Heart Association functional classification of 3. And I told her we're going to admit her to telemetry for her serious condition and we're going to check her vitals every two hours and she can get out of bed with assistance. um strict IO, daily weight will be monitored, DVT prophylaxis, giving her some oxygen to help keep her sat, that's about 98% with the nursing interventions. Keep her on a low sodium diet and IV fluids, KVO. No pain medication. We were gonna start on amiodarone to help with her non-sustained vtach. The lisinopril's fine to keep taking for her high blood pressure. And then her prednisone we're are going to increase to help with sarcoidosis in her heart and lungs. We also are gonna add furosemide to help with the edema she's experiencing. And then we're going to consult interventional cardiologists, talk about an ACDI placement, and a radiologist to do a FDG PET scan to look at her heart better. And that's it.",,
Student 105,.mp3,Student 105.mp3,"and I'm presenting to you today the case that I saw in the emergency room. I saw a 62-year-old female. She came in with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Um he reports that the onset of this occurred around two weeks ago, which she reported to her family medicine practice. Uh they advised that she come in to be examined. She did report that she is experiencing and paroxysmal orthopnea, which uh her dyspnea is worsened by strenuous activity or being active, whereas her orthopnea is worsened by laying down. Um rest relieves her dyspnea and her orthopnea is relieved where she has to prop herself up on pillows, especially when she's sleeping. Um she also reports that during exertion, she does feel presyncopal episodes coming on, and as well as she has, she's significant for palpitations. Uh the patient was alert and coherent, however she was fatigued and pretty concerned about her current condition. Our review of systems yielded she was negative for chest pain. She, again, was positive for palpitations and syncope. She denied wheezing or coughing, just dyspnea and orthopnea was positive.  Her, she did report that she did experience edema, and pulmonary edema specifically. And her past medical history is significant for pulmonary sarcoidosis, which she takes prednisone 10 milligrams for. And she's also significant for hypertension, which she takes 10 milligrams of lisinopril for. Um she does report that she is consistent with her medication and she uses it as prescribed. Her mother is also, her family history yielded that her mother did die suddenly of an unexplained cause um at 40 years old and then her father did die at 59 years old from a uh from a ischemic cardiac event. She does report that she has known on drug allergies. Upon physical exam, it yielded that she was tachycardic. She had a heart rate of 110. Her O2, or her pulse ox was 91%. Her respiration was 20 breaths per minute. She was mildly hypertensive. She was 130 over 90. And, um you know, continuing with the physical exam. She, pulses were intact bilateral. There were no bruits present. And auscultation did yield a cardiac murmur. And there was bilateral rails as well as pitting edema present. Um uh chest x-ray did, you know, reviewing the chest x-ray, it did reveal pulmonary edema as well as mediastinal fullness and pulmonary infiltrates, uh which were detected, which were positive for a pawnbroker sign. Her echocardiogram did yield that there was uh thickening, and there was a preserved ejection fraction of the heart, and her EKG did demonstrate that there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. So regarding her labs, her BNP was also significantly elevated to 4,000. And this was discussed with the patient as far as clinical findings are concerned. So given this information, I would say her, she also reports that she is a non-smoker, non-drinker. She's fairly active, which is how she noticed that something was going on. So regarding this information, I do believe that she is suffering from sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy and I would classify her as New York Heart Association class three. She has secondary diagnosis of hypertension as well as pulmonary edema um and my plan for this patient is to admit to telemetry. I want to consult with uh interventional cardiology as well as radiology. So we can go ahead and see if there may be a need for a pacemaker or we could also get a FED PET. Additionally, um as far as orders are concerned, she can be activity as monitored activity or support. She's gonna be on nasal cannula and I like to start DVT prophylaxis, as well as strict IO and daily weights. Additionally, I would like to continue her with lisinopril. However, I would like to increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams. And then I would also like to start her on amiodarone 150, so it can improve her cardiac output, um and also for SVT. And as far as lifestyle modifications are concerned, um uh you know, as long as she maintains healthy way diet and weight reduction, she may be able to, you know when she meets with invention interventional cardiology and nuclear medicine, um she may be able to, you know, have a better or an improved outcome. Thank you so much, and I look forward to discussing this case with you. Bye.",,
Student 106,.mp3,Student 106.mp3,"Okay, good afternoon. So we have a 60-year-old woman who's presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient has experienced flu-like symptoms days prior to arrival. She states that her breathing is labored and sleeps in her recliner to alleviate the symptoms of shortness of breath. Her activity level has drastically decreased and her symptoms improve upon rest. She had a fever, cough, and runny nose, which has since subsided days prior. um patient also has chest pain, slight palpitations, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patient denies syncope and abnormal skin rashes or lesions. On further review of symptoms, patient does complain of wheezing and swelling in her lower legs. The patient was previously diagnosed with hypertension in which she is currently taking lisinopril 10 milligrams by mouth daily. And the patient denies consuming alcohol, using illicit drugs, and smoking any tobacco products. Her vital signs that were within normal limits included the blood pressure, which was 130 over 90, and her temperature, which was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Her elevated vital signs included the heart rate, which was 110, and respiratory rate, which was 20. Her oxygen saturation level was decreased. It read 91%. And on physical exam, pitting edema was shown in her lower extremities, and also rails and wheezing were noted during lung auscultation. Hypertension, actually, primary assessment is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy due to previous viral infraction. However, hypertension could be provided as a secondary assessment. And the plan to treat these symptoms would be to admit the patient to telemetry units just for monitoring. And we also want to begin nursing to have her on a strict IO to do daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and to place the patient on the O2 nasal cannula to increase the oxygen saturation to 96%. And also we wanna give her medications with lisinopril, acetaminophen, and furosemide. Wanna do 10 milligrams by mouth of lisinopril, 625 milligrams by mouth every six hours of acetaminophen, and 40 milligrams of furosemide IV. And because she's on furosemide, we want to make sure we order a CMP because her troponin levels were also high and her BNP was also high. We want to make sure we order troponin levels to be monitored and to do a repeat echocardiogram. That's her chest x-ray and her echo showed, her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly and the echo showed the left ventricular ejection fraction weight was below 30 percent. And we also want to have interventional cardiology follow her as well as infectious disease and radiology. She's going to get a contrast enhanced MRI of her heart, as well as be put on immunoglobulins or glucocorticoids because of the infection. And we would like to look at an endomyocardial biopsy, as well as CRTD and AICD, which is just the pacemaker and defibrillation, and we will have the patient continue to be monitored and checked every two hours while on the floor. Thank you.",,

He also stated that he is having trouble laying down, so he's having trouble laying down breathing, so I believe he's got some orthopnea, some dyspnea going on as well. And he states that these symptoms are going on at rest. I looked at his um x-ray, his x-ray showed some pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, and then I looked at his lab results and saw that his BNP is um severely elevated, showing some fluid buildup in the heart as well as an elevated troponin, which shows some damage to the heart that's going on. I believe what's going on is ischemic heart disease. I think the next best step in his treatment should be um to admit him to the ICU. I believe that we should have him follow up with the cardiologist for a possible AICD placement and or a CRTD placement.

X-ray results showed cardiomyogaly with pulmonary edema. 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with lab ventricle ejection fraction of 30%. EKG results showed sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block. Patient lab test also showed elevated troponin and BNP. Based on all these available tests and clinical examinations, our determined patient had myocarditis, dilated cardiomegaly, and admitted her to telemetry. Based on patient information, I also sent her a class 4 heart failure. I'm also adding 625 mg acetaminophen and 40 mg ibuprofen to her medications along with continuations of 10 mg lisinopril. I'm also ordering serial troponin and CMP lab tests as well as repeat of 2D echo. I am setting her up to have consultation with interventional cardiology to discuss about potential placing any device placement as well as doing an endomyocardial biopsy. I'm also setting her up with infectious disease to go over about the immunoglobulin or glucocorticoid to better manage her condition right now. And radiology for MRI. I shared all of this information with the care team and discussed about necessity to recheck all her initial vitals as well as check vitals every two hours. I'm also advised low sodium diet for now.

Um Ms. Palmer said that she saw her family physician a few days ago with similar symptoms, um unresolved, and its symptoms worsened to go to the ED. Ms. Palmer said a few weeks ago, she had flu-like symptoms with fever, cough, runny nose, and shortness of breath and fatigue. Most of those symptoms went away a few days ago, other than the shortness of breath and fatigue. Ms. Palmer said that she uses pillows to sleep so she's elevated and she has no tried no treatments and the only alleviating factor for shortness of breath is to sit upright. Um she continued to go into the gym after her flu-like symptoms but eventually had to stop due to symptoms worsening and she said that her symptoms get a lot worse with exercise and moderate activity, but day-to-day activities are mainly unaffected. um the patient presented with an increased heart rate at 110 and decreased oxygen saturation. uh surgical history includes a cardiac catheterization procedure about a year ago. uh the patient told me that there's no medical history, though they are on lisinopril, which leads me to believe that the patient does have hypertension. The patient has a balanced diet and does moderate exercise weekly, about two to three times a week. The mother has a history of breast cancer and passed away at 85 years old, and the father has dementia and is currently in a nursing home. Review of systems included a well-developed, well-nourished patient who is fatigued and in pain, and has gained eight pounds since two weeks ago. This may be due to her lower extremity edema and swelling, and myalgia, which was shown on the physical exam. The patient complained of heart fluttering and had heart palpitations and a laterally displaced PMI. uh the patient complained of wheezing and coughing and uhh dyspnea and orthopnea, with orthopnea being worse.

Student 115,.mp3,Student 115.mp3,"report on a patient I saw in uh clinic today. uh Mr. Leslie Palmer presented today with complaints of um some shortness of breath, some fluttering, wheezing, uh near syncope upon walking with friends for approximately 45 minutes. uh patient states that it's been happening now for a couple of weeks. They do not have any pain or any coughing though. The symptoms are alleviated with rest. Um it's really just the walking extensive amounts of time or any uh larger exertions cause that near syncope. The patient said that they are able to do everyday activities around the house uh without any symptoms, but they said when they do have those symptoms, they would rate it a 10, that it was absolutely terrible. They felt like they would absolutely uh pass out without rest. So um looking a little bit more into the patient's history, their um mother does, or had a sudden death at the age of 40. Their father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 69. The patient himself did present with hypertension and he was taking uh lisinopril for that, 10 milligrams, but he also does not have any uh allergies to any drugs. Patients said that they haven't been hospitalized for anything, but they did have uh a heart cath approximately a year ago. It was an outpatient procedure and um all the results came back normal. No other surgeries other than that. um patients said that they do have a balanced diet. They exercise pretty regularly, but obviously they've been limited now  uh with the oncoming of symptoms. With exercise, uh they report, and that was three to four times a week typically before symptoms caught on. They report no drug use, no tobacco use, no alcohol use. Normal caffeine intake, about a cup of coffee a day. uh they are employed as a seventh grade math teacher um and they are uh married to a man monogamous relationship of 22 years. uh patient reports no general findings, uh no neuro findings. Patient does, as I said before, complain of a flutter, near syncope, but uh without any chest pain. Patient does have shortness of breath and wheezing. The shortness of breath is uh when they're standing upon exertion, it's not specifically when they lie down. Presented today, they were slightly tachycardic with a heart rate of 110, which I discussed with them um as being possible that it's a pathology, but also with the uh with the idea of white coat syndrome, it could have easily been just because of their current presentation. Their oxygen saturation was 96% um and their blood pressure upon presentation was 130 over 90, with a normal temperature of 98.6 and normal respirations of 16. With the patient's presentation and physical exam um, with physical exam findings, I did find that they had pitting edema, um minor pitting edema of the lower extremity. Um I did hear the bilateral rails. I heard the wheezing. I heard um, upon examination of the aorta and the PMI, I didn't find any aortic aneurysm, but I did find a displaced PMI laterally, bilaterally. Um and upon my osteopathic screening was negative, and upon my physical exam as a whole, I did come to the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis for Mr. Palmer was familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I did inform him that that could be a cause of his mother's unfortunate passing. And it is something that's inherited typically. I admitted Mr. Palmer uh to telemetry so he can have constant heart monitoring. And um I am switching his medication. I did not note it on the form, but I have notified the nurse that I'm switching the medication from lisinopril to disopyramide and I am going to have his vitals checked every two hours. We're going to refer to the cardiologist for a uh, for a pacemaker placement and as well as to the cardiothoracic surgeon for a possible myomectomy or alcohol injection to help with that septal hypertrophy. I reviewed his results. He understood the EKG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as the X-ray finding of cardiomegaly, as well as the echo. So Mr. Leslie was alert. He was well and oriented and he had no further questions regarding my workup um  and yeah I told him that he would follow up with you and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out. He's a pleasant dude and hopefully he gets up and at him sooner rather than later. Thanks.",,
Student 116,.mp3,Student 116.mp3,"I mean, Mr. Leslie Palmer, a 62-year-old male who presents to the ER with dyspnea and orthopnea and fatigue. He believes it's been going on for six months and has gotten progressively worse. He went to the family physician. Last week, they had run some labs, but they have not given him any updates on that. So he came in today because he felt more worse. He does not, uh he used to work out, but he's not alleviated by rest now. So he's been lessening his working out. And he is a NYHA class four candidate because of the rest, and he only can sleep in his chair. But laying down flat makes it worse. His vitals were 98.6 temperature. His heart rate was 90. His blood pressure was 80 over 50. His respiratory rate was 22, and his O2 stat was 86. His social history is good, but he's still a pack a day smoker and a moderate caffeine user with one cup a day. And he lives with his wife for 30 years. He feels well supported and happy with her. He also is a school teacher for eighth grade and he feels that he likes his job. His medical history that's pertinent is that he has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. His diabetes, he feels, is well-regulated by his medication. He is on lisinopril, 10 milligrams, atrovastatin, 10 milligrams, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, metformin, 500 milligrams a day, furosemide, 20 milligrams a day, metroprolol  succinate, 50 milligrams a day, and warfarin, 2.5 milligrams a day. He has had a history of uh CABG and five stents over the past five years. His cardiologist says that he does not want to do any more since his last stent was June, 2022. His father has history with Alzheimer's who is still with us and in uh a nursing home right now. His mother died from breast cancer five years ago and his physical exam showed a positive for JVD, uh plus one pitting edema in his lower extremity and his pulses were equal. His uh DP and PT pulses were equal. He has bilateral rails and wheezing present on his evaluation. No murmur or rub. Plus tachycardia split S1. EKG showed a left bundle branch block with LVH criteria, normal sinus rhythm. His troponin levels were 0.04 elevated. BMP and his chest xray showed cardio- cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His echo showed dilated left ventricular with 30 percent ejection fraction. We all agreed, we I believe I should admit him to the ICU. So that is what we did. We're going to have to bring in an interventional cardiologist who can do an AICD and a CRTD. We're going to put him on dobutamine and take off his other medications. He can stay on clopidogrel and warfarin. We'd like to stop every other medication, put him on insulin sliding scale, give him BiPAP for that 86 O2, put him on a low-sodium diet, strict bed rest, and monitor his serial troponins.",,
Student 117,.mp3,Student 117.mp3,"presenting with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. He was alert, awake, and oriented, but obviously fatigued.um he stated that these symptoms have become progressively worse over the last six months. Mr. Palmer states that all activity exacerbates his shortness of breath and fatigue, and he does confirm that he's still having symptoms at rest. He states that lying flat worsens his condition, nothing improves it, and that he has been sleeping in his chair at night. um his respiratory rate was high at 22, his blood pressure was low at 80 over  50, and his oxygen saturation was low at 86%. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, for which he takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once a day, warfarin 2.5 milligrams twice a day, clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day, metformin 500 milligrams twice a day, atorvastatin 10 milligrams once a day, furosemide 20 milligrams twice a day, and metoprolol succinate 50 milligrams once a day. And the patient also reported a triple bypass previously and that he's had five stents with the last being in June, 2022 for a left anterior descending occlusion. The patient said that at that time, his physician told him he was not going to be a candidate for any more procedures and he's had no other hospitalizations besides for those cardiac procedures. He has a maternal family history of terminal breast cancer and a paternal family history of Alzheimer's. The patient did endorse fatigue and eight pound weight gain over two weeks, wheezing, dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema of the lower extremities today. His physical exa- exam showed JVD without carotid bruits, tachycardia with a split S2, laterally displaced PMI uh bibasilar rails and wheezing on auscultation of his lungs. He had a uh plus one pitting edema with intact distal pulses and non-tender calves in his lower extremities. His labs showed a troponin of 0.04 and a BNP of 4000, both of which are high. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. His 2D echo showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 30 percent, and his EKG showed a left axis displacement with a left bundle branch block. I diagnosed him today with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to his previous cardiac history, his physical exam, and the labs I got back today, as well as that imaging. He is a New York Heart Association stage four and should be admitted to the ICU. His condition is serious. He has no known drug allergies. I'd like him to have vitals every two hours, strict bed rest, strict input output, daily weights, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. I'd like him on a low sodium diet. I'd like him on an IV fluid protocol of fluid lock, keep vein open. I'm going to hold all meds except his clopidogrel 75 milligrams once a day, and his warfarin 2.5 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to add a dobutamine IV drip and an insulin sliding scale. The patient should be on BiPAP with an input of 16 and an output of 6. I would like him to have serial troponins to monitor his um troponin level since it was high earlier. And I'd like him to continue having um PT INRs to monitor his clotting as we have him on both clopidogrel and warfarin um. I will be consulting interventional cardiology to discuss the possible placement of a CRTD or an AICD. And then after discharge, the patient will be instructed to maintain a healthy diet, weight, and then avoid strenuous activity until he is released by his cardiologist. Overall, I think his outlook looks pretty good. And please go see him whenever you're ready. Thank you.",,
Student 118,.mp3,Student 118.mp3,"Mr. Palmer is a 62-year-old male who presented to the clinic today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. His vitals show a blood pressure of 80 over 50, a heart rate of 90, SpO2 of 86, pulse of 90, and temperature of 98.6. Mr. Palmer stated that these symptoms have been going on for the past six months and have worsened progressively. He visited his primary care physician a few days ago and symptoms have exponentially worsened since. He states he is unable to perform any physical activities as he experiences extreme shortness of breath but is okay at rest. He states that he cannot breathe when laying down and laying down to sleep and therefore has to sleep upright. Patient denies any pain and no medications were taken to help with the symptoms. Patient has not experienced anything like this before and rates his discomfort at a 10 out of 10. Review of symptoms showed showed fatigue, weight gain, wheezing, orthopnea, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. Mr. Palmer's other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation for which he takes metoprolol, 50 milligrams once a day, lisinopril, 10 milligrams once a day, atorvastatin, 10 milligrams once a day, metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day, furosemide, 20 milligrams twice a day, clopidogrel, 75 milligrams once a day, and Warfarin, 2.5 milligrams twice a day.

Patient's social history includes a balanced diet with moderate caffeine intake, no alcohol or illicit drug consumption. Patient smokes one pack per day for the past 30 years and appropriate counseling was provided. Patient is married and has a stable occupation. Pertinent physical exam findings include positive jugular venous distension with no bruits, heart auscultation revealed a tachycardia with a split S2 and no murmurs. Palpation revealed a laterally displaced PMI and no chest wall tenderness. Lung auscultations revealed bibasilar rails and wheezing with plus one pitting edema noted with full pulses and negative homan sign or calf tenderness. OMM examination revealed no TART changes or tenderness upon palpation of Chapman's points. Labs include elevated troponin at 0.4 and elevated BNP at 4,000. X-rays show cardio cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echo revealed dilated chambers with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. And EKGs revealed normal sinus rhythm, meaning left meaning left left m ventricle hypertrophy voltage criteria and left bundle brand block. A likely diagnosis in this case is ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mr. Palmer was counseled was counseled on his smoking habits and advised that this may worsen the problem. The patient was also advised that this condition is likely due to his past cardiac medical history. The patient was admitted to telemetry and has a NYHA-4 classification. All current medications will be withheld except clopidogrel and warfarin, and dobutamine and an insulin sliding scale will be started. Patient was on BiPAP to assist with oxygenation. A PT, INR, and serial troponin will be reordered and monitored. Patient is on strict bed rest with IO, daily weights, monitoring, DVT prophylaxis, low sodium diet, and KBO. Vitals will be checked Q2H. Interventional cardiology was consulted and a patient will be taken for AICD and CRTD placement. Thank you.",,

Her onset has been worsening for the past two months but has gotten especially bad in the past three days since visiting with her primary care physician on Friday. She was advised to go to the emergency department because of her symptoms. She's comfortable at rest, awake, alert, and oriented, and also reports multiple episodes of near-syncope um within the past two months. Uh she has a past medical history of hypertension and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Uh her past medical her past surgical history uh includes a heart catheter that she said that it was normal. Um her mom passed away at 40 years old sudden sudden death, and her father passed away at 59 years old for a myocardial infarction. Um her social, she has a well balanced diet. She enjoys going on walks. No illicit drug use, no tobacco, no alcohol. She's currently an elementary school teacher. She reports having one cup of coffee per day before work so she can get through. Um and she's been married for the past 30 years, has one sexual partner. So her current medications include lisinopril and uh prednisone for the sarcoidosis and uh lisinopril for the hypertension. She has no known drug allergies. Um she reported fatigue, so the only pertinent positives for her review systems were fatigue, palpitations, wheezing, and lower extremity swelling especially um around her ankles. Her physical findings were positive for JVD um positive for or negative for bruits uh positive for palpitations and there was a murmur present, uh early systolic murmur. Uh she reported wheezing and bibasilar rales on um auscultation. She um lower extremity edema was found on physical exam as well. Um of her labs, all were negative besides her BNP, which was elevated to 4,000. And her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema, mediastinal fullness, and a normal cardiac silhouette. Her echo showed restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness and an ejection fraction of 55 percent. Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with non-sustained left ventricular tachycardia. Um that's what I saw afterwards, after talking to the patient. Uh new York heart Association Class 2 because she did not report having difficulty with activities besides um exercise. Um and and so this is secondary to her hypertension and her pulmonary sarcoidosis. So the patient was admitted to telemetry uh with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis uh restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to sarcoidosis. Um it is, it's a serious condition. She will be getting vitals q2 hours and out of bed with assistance. Um and nursing instructions include strict ins and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, and O2 via nasal cannula to make sure that it's at least 96 percent um I recommended a low-sodium diet so that we can get some of the fluid off. Uh we included uh keeping the vein open for fluids. Her we will continue the lisinopril but we will also add on, place the furosemide 40 milligrams IV and um increase her prednisone to 60 milligrams, and we'll be administering amiodarone 150 milligrams via IV, uh because of the ventricular tachycardia, and we will also be ordering a CMP panel for labs, and so we can further monitor the sarcoidosis.

She's unsure of what tests were done and she hasn't gotten those results back yet. Um she called them today due to exacerbation of her symptoms and was referred to the ER. She says that her her symptoms are exacerbated with most of her activity. She notes that she was previously very active walking about five times a week, but now is unable to do that due to her symptoms. She also notes orthopnea, noting that she is now sleeping in the recliner due to shortness of breath when lying flat. She denies any loss of consciousness she denies short uh chest pain. She does endorse an eight pound weight gain in the past two weeks, as well as some lower extremity swelling. She also endorses some subjective wheezing. Um her history, as I said, she has pulmonary sarcoidosis which she is on chronic um prednisone, 10 milligrams. She also has hypertension, for which she's on Lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day. She had a clean cardiac cath about a year ago after an abnormal EKG at her PCP. She denies tobacco use, alcohol, illicit drug use. She lives at home with her husband, who she says is supportive. She does have insurance through her job as a fourth grade teacher. Um vitals were significant for slight tachycardia at 110 with slight hypertension at 136/99. Her SpO2 was slightly hypoxic at 91%. She was afebrile. Physical exam was significant for a systolic murmur um with an S4 gallop. She did have positive JVD, but no carotid bruits. She had bibasilar rales and wheeze in her lungs, in both lungs. Um she did have one plus pedal edema with no calf tenderness and negative Homan sign. Labs were remarkable for an elevated troponin of 4,000, or elevated BNP of 4,000, I'm sorry, and a negative troponin. Chest X-ray showed mediastinal fullness um consistent with pulmonary sarcoid. She had no cardiomegaly and no pulmonary edema. EKG did show a sinus tachycardia at a rate of about 100. She had a normal axis. She did have a run of non-sustained uh V-tach on the EKG, um but her rhythm in the room was a normal sinus. Echo did show restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased wall thickness. EF was normal at 55%. I believe that her symptoms are due to uh sarcoidosis restrictive cardiomyopathy with an NYHA scale of 3. Um for her, I would like to admit her to telemetry um and give her amiodarone for the non-sustained V-tach. Keep her on her lisinopril and increase her prednisone dose to 60 milligrams uh a day um PO. I also would like to give 40 milligrams of furosemide IV um for fluid overload. Um as far as labs, I would like to order a CMP to keep an eye on her potassium because we're giving that furosemide. Um I don't believe she needs any uh diagnostic imaging orders at this time but I do want to consult radiology for a possible um FDG PET scan to look at the um infiltrates in her heart.

But he, um more concerning right now is um is his elevated blood work. Uh his troponin high troponins, he has um severe orthopnea, and and very, very uh extensive undue dyspnea on exertion. So um even having dyspnea at rest. But um he has a history of A Fib. He's had um he’s had an open heart surgery, he's had a CABG, he's had a CABG coronary artery bypass graft, um he's had a cardiac stent, one one a year for the last five years. Um none nn his parents didn't necessarily have any sort of um similar issues, he was like I mentioned, he was he is a smoker. Um for his stance on blood he's on clopidogrel, metoprolol, he's on furosemide, lisinopril, um warfarin, metformin. He doesn't have any allergies. Um he has gained eight pounds of edema in his lower extremities that he noted on during the review of systems there's um very few pertinent negatives on our um thing except he has not experienced any chest pain or discomfort. No palpitations, though he says he has uh some sort of on and off A Fib, paroxysmal A Fib, atrial fibrillation. Um and walking in, noticed his blood pressure to be 80/50, um heart rate of 90, respers respers a little bit elevated um a bit a bit um tachypneic if you will and very low O2 sats, spo2 around 86%. Um did have jugular venous distension on physical exam. Um no murmur, friction rub, gallop. Um his PMI was displaced bilaterally and and um sure enough he had a cardiomegaly uh on chest X-ray. Rales sure enough were present um did in fact have pedal edema. Um normal pulses and extremities, uh he does have an ejection fraction um of less than 30% on on 2D echo, uh PLAX view. Um BNP was elevated, troponins elevated um also um classified his as an New York Heart Association, New York Heart Association class 4 heart failure. Um likely now going the direction of adding dobutamine on top of uh the not working um Intervascularly, very dry, nearly as a potato chip, um and he he cannot take any more diuretics, so we're gonna add dobutamine. um so I'd like to add dobutamine. Definitely gonna admit him to the ICU as a critical patient. Um monitor him every two hours. Strict Is and Os, DVT prophylaxis.

I would like to keep his thinner going thinners going do not not adding any sort of diuretics. Um I put him on an insulin sliding scale instead of his metformin. Um of course, monitoring PT INR, and then I'm gonna have interventional cardiology take a look at them, though they had um they said no more stenting or or CABG bypasses. But but it is likely that I would recommend maybe a because of a left bundle branch block and a left axis axis on EKG, I'd recommend a cardio resynchronization therapy device as well as uh an automated internal cardiac defibrillator um if if noted um if deemed so by the interventional cardiologist.

Student 122,.mp3,Student 122.mp3,"She's a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency department due to extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. She did include that about two weeks ago, she was sick with a fever, cough, runny nose, and she thought she just had a cold. She was able to continue to exercise through this time, um but it was just causing some fatigue and shortness of breath. Um she said about five days ago, her symptoms resolved and she thought she was getting better, but then she went to her primary care doctor three days ago because she was still having really bad fatigue when she was trying to do activities. The fatigue and shortness of breath does not occur at rest. I took a history of the patient. Um she does have a medical history of hypertension, and surgical wise she had a cardiac catheter done, but she said there were no significant findings with that. Um she does take one medication, which is lisinopril 10 milligrams. As far as family history, her mom passed away from breast cancer about five years ago and her dad is currently in a home. He has Alzheimer's or dementia but he's still living. As far as her social history, she does not use any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. She works as an elementary school teacher. She said her diet is good and balanced. Her caffeine use is moderate. She says about a cup a day. Um as far as exercise, she does remain active. She likes to go to the gym about three times a week but has been unable to since her cardiac symptoms, shortness of breath, and fatigue started. And as far as living situation, she is married and stated she feels supported and comfortable at home. She has no known drug allergies. As far as her ROS, she did have fatigue and a recent weight gain she stated of about eight pounds. There were no skin issues, um no headache or neck stiffness. She did feel chest palpitations, and she was also positive for wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea, meaning she was more out of breath while she was laying down. She also did notice some lower extremity edema. As far as her appearance, she was awake and oriented. She was just extremely fatigued. Her vital signs, her temperature was 98.6, so no fever. Blood pressure was 130/90. Oxygen was 91. Heart rate 110, and respiratory rate was 20. For physical exam, I didn't hear uh no carotid bruit was present, but she did have JVD. As far as her heart, she had a regular rate. No murmur, friction rub, or gallop were heard, but her PMI was displaced laterally. Wheezes and rales were also present, but she had no chest wall tenderness. She had no calf tenderness. Um her lower extremity pulses were full and equal, and she did have plus one pitting edema. As far as her chest X-ray, this indicated cardiomegaly as well as pulmonary edema, which I explained to the patient. And her echo was indicative of a dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. Her EKG came back as sinus tachy tachycardia with a right bundle branch block. In her labs, her troponin was elevated and her BNP level was 4,000. Now knowing all of this plus her history and her diagnostics, I did make the diagnosis of myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. Um she was at a NYHA classification of 2 because she was still able to do some activity and her symptoms did get better at rest, but they also were triggered when she was exercising. Um therefore, I told the patient that we did are going to need to admit her specifically to telemetry. Her condition was serious. Um she's going to be getting vitals every two hours. Activity is as tolerated. Um as far as nursing interventions, she needs strict I IOs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, maintaining her O2 stat above 96%, and she's also gonna get an O2 nasal cannula. Diet wise, she should be low sodium. IV fluid should be KVO, so just keeping that vein open. And then as far as medications, I instructed the patient we were gonna be giving her a pain med, so that's acetaminophen 625 milligrams by mouth. She can stay on her lisinopril, which is 10 milligrams by mouth daily. That's what she's already taking and she will continue to. And then we're also adding furosemide 40 milligrams by IV. She needs no type of diabetic diabetic intervention, no BiPAP. And for labs, I'm ordering serial troponins as well as a CMP. And she's going to be met by an interventional cardiologist, infectious disease, and radiologist. And they are gonna consult about an AICD placement, a CRTD placement, doing a media enhanced MRI, as well as a myocardial endomyocardial biopsy. The patient was instructed of all of this, that she would be admitted, doing additional labs and testing, that we were going to keep her on some medicine, as well as add a painkiller and a medicine that was going to improve her cardiac function. And patient was agreeable to the plan. She stated she has a good support system at home, as well as insurance, and she was comfortable moving forward with this.",,

Upon physical examination it did reveal that he had positive JVD a PMI that was displaced laterally and you could hear wheezing and rales bilaterally upon auscultation. He also presented with lower extremity edema. His x-ray results showed cardiomegaly and his echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy. His left atrium was enlarged, and there was some hyperkinesia with an LVEF of 60%. His EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with tall R waves in the septal leads. In summary, Leslie Palmer presents with shortness of breath, heart palpitations, cardiomegaly, which point to a familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And his NI NYHA scale was about a 2 because um with some physical exercise would produce the symptoms. His condition is considered serious. He will have his vitals monitored every two hours. Activity is as tolerated and nursing instructions are strict in and outs, daily weight, DVT prophylaxis, O2 via nasal cannula maintain O2 sats above 96%. His diet is normal and IV fluids are saline lock. His medications we will discontinue lisinopril and initiate disopyramide. The we will also consult interventional cardiology for AICD placement, as well as the cardiothoracic surgeon for possible future septal myectomy or alcohol injection to reduce LVOT. Thank you. Bye.",,
Student 126,.mp3,Student 126.mp3,"So Mr. Palmer is a 62 year old male who presents to the ER today um complaining of shortness of breath that started two weeks ago while he was walking with some friends after work. He says while he was walking it just kind of hit him suddenly and he got really short of breath, um he felt really fatigued and he felt like his heart was racing. Um he said after he rested all his symptoms went away but since then every single time that he's uh done any bit of like uh light exercise, like moving around and walking like he did, um he starts to get that shortness of breath. Um he says he also will intermittently get the palpitations. Because of this, he went and saw his family medicine physician three days ago, and um they did some labs and imaging, and then I guess they got the results today, and he said that he was called by them today and told to come to the ER so that we could evaluate him. Um he doesn't have any other complaints. Um he hasn't noticed any leg swelling. Um he hasn't noticed any like recent fever, chills, cough, um no recent rash. Uh he hasn't been sweating with any of these events. Um what he said his initial complaint has been the only thing that's bothered him. Um he says something like this has never happened before. Um uh he doesn't complain of any chest pain right now, but about a year ago he says that he did uh have a heart cath after he had um an abnormal EKG on like a routine physical. He said that um his heart cath showed uh he had no blockages, so um he hasn't had any issues with that since then until this event. Um he has a history of high blood pressure. He takes lisinopril lisinopril 10 milligrams um once a day for that. Um he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, um hasn't used any illicit drugs like cocaine ever in the past. Um he's an elementary school teacher. He has a regular diet and he says that he regularly exercises everyday after work he'll go on a walk with his friends but he hasn't been able to do that in the last two weeks because of his symptoms. Um his family history is significant um his father died of a heart attack at the age of 59 and his mother died unexpectedly um at the age of 40. He says he doesn't know why. Um on physical his he's tachycardic, heart rate of 110, um he was hypertensive with um uh blood pressure of 130 over 90. He says he has been taking his meds and he hasn’t missed any  doses. Um he also says he doesn't have any medication allergies. Um his O2 sat was 96 on room air. Um he's awake, alert, um sitting comfortably. While I talked to him, he was able to lay down without any shortness of breath while I did his physical. Um he didn't have any JVD or a bruit, a carotid bruit um or abdominal uh bruit or palpable aneurysm that I could feel. Um his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He uh had a regular rhythm on uh while auscultating his heart he did have an S4 murmur uh systolic. Um no rubs, but he did have the gallop. Um he didn't have any chest wall tenderness. He didn't have any edema. Uh he had good, strong DP and PT pulses. Um his calves were equal in size and Homan sign was negative. Um when reviewing his um labs from the doctor's office they did a troponin a BNP on him. Both were normal. Um his EKG had some um LVH, but it was um normal rhythm and rate. Um on his chest x-ray he had cardiomegaly but his lungs were clear bilaterally. His airways were intact, trachea midline. Um he didn't have any fractures. The only thing significant was cardiomegaly. Um his echo, he had um an enlarged intraventricular interventricular septum um which I assume is why they sent him over. So um I told him we would admit him, um put him on some oxygen just to get that up a little bit since his O2 sat is like 96, it could be better. Um then we would have the interventional cardiologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon follow up with him while he's in hospital um and we would start him on the dipyridine instead of him taking the lisinopril. Um and then he's on uh exercise um restrictions until he's cleared by another physician. And he was agreeable to be admitted to telemetry.",2:58 not sure if saying when or while,
Student 127,.mp3,Student 127.mp3,"Hi there um I'd like to do a case presentation today um on Ms. Palmer, um a 62-year-old female um came in today complaining of um chest pain, um dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. Um patient states that a week ago she'd been dealing with flu-like symptoms, specifically a cold, fever, um and those had subsided. However, her fatigue has persisted since then. Um patient has a past medical history of hypertension. uh she treats that with lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. Um patient has a past surgical history of a cardiac catheter a year ago, was performed was performed for having an abnormal EKG. Family history, um mother has a history of breast cancer um passed away um no pertinent medical history for father. Um in terms of uh review of systems um patient uh has gained 8 pounds in the last week stated uh additionally uh patient has uh palpitations that have been coinciding with her chest pain recently, she stated. Uh patient has also noticed uh severe orthopnea as well um when lying down and is now sleeping in a recliner. Has also wheezing and coughing. Um and in terms of um muscle pain, uh patient states that she has uh bilateral radiating muscle pain in her lower extremities as well. Um on physical exam, I noticed uh patient's blood pressure was elevated um at 130/90. Um the patient was also tachycardic at a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Um uh upon auscultation, um I noticed the patient had bilateral rales in her lungs. Um additionally, patient uh had bilateral jugular venous distension as well, um and she had bilateral pitting edema um in her lower extremities. Um in regards to um my plan moving forward, um I think uh Ms. Palmer should be admitted to the hospital, um likely uh diagnosis being um myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. Um I uh think um moving forward we should be consulting cardiology for treatment of potential arrhythmia um consulting infectious disease to try and control potential inflammation um from infection um and as well as uh radiology for um considering an MRI to have a more in depth um look at the extent of damage to the heart. Um in terms of medications to be using um uh continue lisinopril uh for the patient to decrease blood pressure, and also consider adding furosemide as well um to try and remove excess fluid from the patient.

Student 128,.mp3,Student 128.mp3,"presenting the patient that I saw, who was Leslie Palmer a 62-year-old male presenting with chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. Patient states that the symptoms started a few weeks ago when he was with his friends. He started feeling lightheaded and like he was going to pass out. Patient is comfortable at rest but has symptom onset uh when he performs physical activity, such as going for longer walks. He also notes heart palpitations and rasping. ROS was positive for fatigue, lightheadedness, pre-syncope, palpitations, wheezing, and dyspnea on exertion. Past medical history was significant for hypertension. Past surgical history was significant for a heart cath one year ago that turned up normal. Past family history, his mom passed away or died when she was 40 years old due to an unknown cause. It was a sudden death. his father passed away or died when he was 69 from a myocardial infarction. For social history, he does patient does not drink, does not smoke, and does not use illicit drugs. He consumes a balanced diet and moderate caffeine. He exercises 3 to 3 to 5 times per week until the last few weeks. He has not been exercising due to his symptoms. He is a teacher and he lives with his husband. For medications, he takes lisinopril 10 milligrams once daily for his hypertension. He has no known drug allergies. His vital signs were normal except for an elevated heart rate of 110. Physical exam was positive for jugular venous distension bibasilar rales and wheezing, PMI displaced laterally, and 1 plus pitting edema in the lower extremities. Otherwise, the physical exam was normal. His chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. His labs were normal, including troponin and BNP. His echo showed left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement with left ventricular hyperkinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria with tall R waves in the septal leads. Based on these results and the patient's past medical history and his presenting symptoms, I believe that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I recommend that we admit him to telemetry. His condition is serious. He I recommend that we take his vitals every two hours. He can do activity as tolerated. Nursing interventions include strict ins and outs, daily weights, DVT prophylaxis, and oxygen via nasal canula to maintain oxygen saturations over 60 96%. His diet can be regular. IV fluids keep vein open. Medications I recommend we discontinue lisinopril and instead start disopyramide 100 milligrams four times daily. I recommend we consult with interventional cardiology to discuss AICD placement. I also recommend we we consult with cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss possible septal myomectomy and alcohol injection. Thank you.",,
Student 129,.mp3,Student 129.mp3,"I'm presenting to you Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old female who came into the hospital after her primary care doctor advised her to do so. She presented with a complaint of shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations, which occurred as a result of physical activity, like walking or even getting up. When she moves at all, her symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath start to occur. And then a couple of minutes later, with some rest they'll go away. She'll occasionally wake up struggling to breathe and occasionally she'll have shortness of breath if she's laying down flat. But if she sits up she gets better. She has a past surgical history of getting a heart cath a couple years ago but she's never been hospitalized. She takes lisinopril 10 milligram and prednisone 10 milligram currently and she has no allergies. Her past medical history includes high blood pressure and sarcoidosis. Her medical issues have been handled relatively well until her new issues arise. Her father passed away of sudden unexplained death a few years ago, and her mother had a heart attack at 59. She doesn't smoke, use tobacco, or illicit drugs. Currently, she's a elementary school teacher who has been able to continue working and eat a healthy balanced diet. She used to walk daily, but recently she hasn't been able to walk as often due to her issues. My review of systems found that she had gained 8 pounds in the past week and had swelling in her legs. She also had the issues of dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, and palpitations. The remaining review symptoms were negative. I performed a physical exam and found wheezing and lower extremity edema. Her lab test showed an elevated BMP. Her chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema with mediastinal fullness, but no altered cardiac silhouette. An echocardiogram showed restricted cardiomyopathy with an enlarged wall and a slightly decreased ejection fraction. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia. After her appointment I would like to diagnose her with sarcoidosis restricted cardiomyopathy. NYHA class 3 and secondary hypertension and secondary pulmonary sarcoidosis. I ordered her to be admitted to telemetry with vitals every 2 hours, out of bed with assistance, strict IO, daily weight, a nasal canula to maintain an o2 saturation of 96 percent. She also will get daily weight, a low sodium diet, saline lock KVO for fluids. She'll continue taking lisinopril lisinopril 10 milligram and I will increase her prednisone dosage to 60 milligrams. And then I'll add amiodarone 150 milligrams and furosemide 40 milligrams via IV. She will get a repeat CMP to check for differences and she'll see a interventional cardiologist to consider putting in an AICD. She will also see a nuclear medicine radiologist to get an FD FDG PET scan to look for further issues.","the opening first word - I cannot make out what is is, got cut off",
Student 130,.mp3,Student 130.mp3,"Case presentation on our new patient, Mr. Palmer um he's a 62-year-old male presenting with the chief complaint of dyspnea orthopnea and fatigue that started six months ago. that has gotten worse in the past three days. Um the patient went to their family family medicine doctor. Um they ran a couple of tests and the family medicine referred him to the ED the emergency department. Um he has a history of hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, and A Fib, which he takes lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, metformin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and warfarin for. He has no known drug allergies. He has gained a couple of pounds in the past two weeks and also has bouts of palpitations. He also mentioned swelling in his ankle. Um he has a surgical history of a triple coronary artery bypass and five coronary stents put in. Regarding his social history, he has a history of tobacco use, smoking one pack per day for the last 30 years. He also drinks one cup of coffee a day. He currently lives with his wife and is generally active and walks regularly, but he has not been able to do so recently.

Now in regards to his vitals temperature was 90 98.6 heart rate was 90 respiratory rate was 22 and blood pressure was 80/50 and oxygen sat was 86%. Cardiopulmonary and physical exam showed positive JVD tachycardia gallop rales and wheezing, all is present. The patient showed no signs of carotid or abdominal abdominal bruit. He had pedal edema and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were full bilateral. They were equal. Um his lab showed elevated troponin and BMP at 4000. X-ray showed pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction at 30% and the patient claimed that uh prior imaging showed that he had a ejection fraction of 40% so now it is lower an EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis, and left bundle branch block. Homan's sign testing for DVT was negative. At this point ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was suspected um so I spoke to him about the diagnosis and that the condition is serious. I also inquired about his social support and insurance. At this time he will be admitted to the E ICU. Vitals will be taken every two hours and activity are activity instructions are strict bed rest.

Uh musculoskeletal review of system indicated a uh uh uh lower extremity edema. And the EENT was negative for anything. Pulmonary test uh um indicated uh dyspnea as well as orthopnea. Neuro test was negative. Skin test was uh negative, as well as cardio test was also negative. Um after this, uh a surgical history was taken in which the patient noted was noted to have uh uh have previously had a triple bypass cardiac surgery as well as a stent placement.

Uh there was no noted allergies. As for the social history, the patient uh patient noted that uh his food intake was very balanced. Um his exercise routine uh the patient uh noted that uh he used to go he used to uh uh like to uh walk. However, now that the dyspnea and orthopnea uh has gotten even worse, it's too difficult to do these activities. So he does not exercise. Uh as for drugs, there is no drug drug use or illicit drug use. Uh there is no other, uh the patient has been smoking tobacco for the last 30 years or has been smoking for the last 30 years. Uh the patient has no alcohol intake. However, as for caffeine, the patient uh does drink one cup of coffee a day.

Student 132,.mp3,Student 132.mp3,"to you today so I had just finished seeing Mrs. Palmer. She's a 62 year old woman who presents to the emergency department today with complaints of cough, shortness, excuse me, with complaints of shortness of breath, um chest pain and fatigue. She claims that a couple of uh a few days ago, she had a viral infection for which she had cough, she had fever, and just general malaise. She saw her primary care physician for which she says that the symptoms resolved except for her shortness of breath and fatigue and currently she's experiencing chest pain. As of now she does not have a fever but she does have shortness of breath and fatigue. Uh when I asked her what aggravates uh the shortness of breath she says that any daily activities like walking around really makes her feel the shortness of breath and fatigue but sitting in a reclined seat so like sitting in her recliner um alleviates her symptoms. She also describes the chest pain as this dull chest pain. When I asked her about her past medical history, she told me that she has a history of hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams a day. She does not have any known allergies, um neither to any food or medication. When I asked her for past hospitalization, she claims that she had a catheter uh cardiac catheterization placed one year ago. Her family history, her mother passed away of breast cancer and her father's currently um in an assisted living facility dealing with Alzheimer's. When I asked her about her social history, specifically her diet, she claims that she has a well-balanced diet, that she eats a lot of meats, um vegetables, fruits and vegetables. She also claims um for her caffeine intake that she only takes one cup of coffee, no alcohol, no tobacco use, um and she does not take illicit drugs. Um exercise wise, she used to be able to go to the gym twice a week, but now with her shortness of breath, she's not able to do that. Um and her living situation is that she lives currently with her husband, and she is a school teacher for her occupation. Now, when going through uh the review systems. Uh for general general review of system, everything was negative except for um an eight pound weight gain within the last two weeks. All skin uh review systems were negative. All HEENT review systems were negative. Neuro, everything was negative. Pulmonary, the only positive findings were positive wheezing, cough, dyspnea, and orthopnea. For cardiac, the only thing that she claims was positive was palpitation and chest pain. And for MSK, the only thing that she claimed, uh that she reported was swelling of her legs and muscle aches. All else were negative. So for her physical exam, her vitals, her heart rate was 110, which was a little bit elevated. Her blood pressure was 130/90, uh as well elevated elevated, and excuse me, her temperature was 98.6 and O2 saturation was 91%. Um physical exam findings, she had a positive JVD. She had bibasilar wheezing, edema in her leg, and her PMI was displaced laterally. When I looked at her labs, she had elevated troponin and BNP. Um her chest X-ray did show edema and cardiomegaly, and her EKG showed premature ventricular contractions, uh left um excuse me left atrial deviation, right bundle branch block, and sinus tachycardia. So I reviewed the labs with the patient, I reviewed the chest x-ray with the patient, I reviewed her EKG um as well as her echo and her echo did show dilated um left ventricular wall dilation with decreased effusion rate, which is around 30%. So I explained all her labs to her. I went over the labs, chest X-ray, EKG, and then we went with the plan. So I told her, considering that she did have a viral infection in the past few days and all her signs pointed to dilated cardiomyopathy, I do believe this is myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy um so her symptoms were due to her previous viral infection. So due to that, I'm going to place her on furosemide to be able to get rid of the edema she has in her legs and in uh her lungs. I also wanna continue her lisinopril for her blood pressure. I'm gonna give her acetaminophen for her chest pain. Um labs wise I am gonna repeat troponin to be to see um if it improves, and we're going to repeat an EK uh excuse me repeat an echo. I also recommended that we add a cardiologist, an intervention interventional cardiologist to the team to be able to see if she's a candidate for um a defibrillator, and add a radiologist to the team and an infectious disease specialist. So with all that, um I do believe the patient does have um hopeful outcomes, and I explained all this to her. She said that she had she was on board with the plan, she had social support at home and that she did have insurance to be able to cover the cost of all this. I also told her that we would be admitting her to the telemetry floor and not the ICU. So admit to telemetry floor. And then I also lastly explained to her that myocarditis was probably due to the viral infection she had before. The patient stated that she understood everything, she did not have any questions at the moment and agreed with our plan. And that was my encounter for today with the lovely Mrs. Palmer and I hope for the best. Thank you so much.",,
Student 133,.mp3,Student 133.mp3,"I just finished meeting with Leslie Palmer. She's a 62-year-old female who presented with chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue. She mentioned this started three weeks ago when she had a cold. She said the chest pain was on her left side, just above her left breast and rated it as dull, constant and achy and a 2 out of 10. She said it did not radiate anywhere. And for the shortness of breath, she said it was relieved by sitting up and bothered her more while lying down. She was awake, alert-oriented, but I did note she was fatigued. Her vitals were a heart rate of 110, so slightly elevated, a respiratory rate of 20, oxygen sats at 91%, which I told her was low, and her respiratory rate slightly high, probably as a compensation for that. Her temperature was normal at 98.6, and her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130/90. However, she does have a history of hypertension so that may be normal for her. For her general review of systems, she had fatigue and a weight gain of 10 uh 8 pounds. um Everything else was negative. Her skin, heent, and neuro review of systems were all negative. For her her cardio, she had chest pain and palpitations, but no near syncope. And for her pulmonary review of system, she had wheezing, dyspnea, and orthopnea. And for her MSK, she had uh lower extremity edema that she mentioned. So as I said, her past medical history is positive for hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril 10 milligrams orally every day. She has no surgical history or hospitalizations or no known drug allergies. Her mother passed away at 80 years old of breast cancer. Her father is currently 89, who is living in a care facility with Alzheimer's. For her personal social history, she eats a well balanced diet. She says she was exercising regularly up until the chest pain and shortness of breath, and so she is not currently exercising. She denies any drugs, tobacco, or alcohol use and drinks one cup of coffee per day. Her occupation is an elementary school teacher and she lives with her husband, who she is married to. I asked her about the um shortness of breath, for which she said it occurs at rest. So that would be a grade 4 NYH scale. On physical exam I noted that she was positive for jugular venous distension. She did not have any bruits. Her heart rate was regular with no murmurs, regurgitations, or gallops. Her PMI was displaced laterally. She did not have any chest wall tenderness, but on auscultation she did have bibasilar rales and wheezing. On her lower extremity exam I noticed plus one pitting edema in the calves. Her calves were not tender um and her pulses were full and normal. Going over her lab work with her, I noted her troponins were high as well as her BNP was elevated at 4000. Her chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema and her echo showed a dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. The EKG showed sinus tach, which was consistent with the monitor we had on her, and a right bundle branch block. So, based on the physical exam history and lab work I diagnosed um myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy. So, we are admitting her to the hospital with telemetry, um serious condition, so we are gonna check vitals every two hours. Activity, I left as tolerated for nursing interventions, strict input output, um maintaining daily weight and DVT prophylaxis and putting a nasal cannula on to maintain her oxygen sats above 96. For IV fluids, we're gonna um add furosemide at 40 milligrams IV to help with the pulmonary edema, and so I want IV fluid status as keep veins open. I prescribed 625 milligrams of oral acetaminophen for the pain and told her she could continue her 10 milligrams of lisinopril daily for her cardiovascular system. Um No other respiratory therapy besides the nasal cannula. For lab orders, I ordered a CMP and serial troponins and a follow-up 2D echo as well. And then consulted radio radiology, cardiology, and infectious disease so that we could get an AICD placed a CRTD and do a biopsy as well as getting her glucocorticoids and a media enhanced MRI. So she'll be admitted into the hospital and we should check in with her frequently. But for now, that is all. Thank you very much",,
Student 134,.mp3,Student 134.mp3,"Leslie Palmer, who is a 62-year-old woman presenting to the ED today with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. Um She had a two-week stint of runny nose, fever, and chest pain. She explains having chest pain to be dull and widespread over the chest uh starting two weeks ago and lasting constantly without any relief Mrs. Palmer had an eight pound weight gain in the last two weeks, presence of palpitations, and a dull, constant chest pain. Uh she has a history of hypertension in which she's taking 10 milligrams of lisinopril per day. Um her mother died of breast cancer and her father is currently residing in an Alzheimer's unit.

Upon reviewing um doing a review of systems of the patient she reported feeling fatigue, has experienced an 8 pound weight gain over the past couple of weeks, is experiencing um palpitations on top of the pre-syncope. um it is exper, it is especially exaggerated whenever she uh exerts herself and whenever she uh lies down. So orthopnea and has noticed some edema in her legs, the patient has a history of hypertension for which she takes 10 mg of lisinopril everyday and has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis for which she takes prednisone 10mg a day.

Uh patient is in our emergency department after seeing her family care practitioner uh three days ago uh and they were encouraged to come in the ER as their shortness of breath did not improve. Patient has experienced dyspnea and orthopnea only relieved by sitting or sleeping in the recliner. Patient has also experienced chest pain uh pressure and dullness, a dull ache in their chest pain. Uh pain is constant and rated as a two out of 10. Okay, uh patient is, has also has also experienced an increase in 8 pound weight gain over the past week or so um along with the experiencing fatigue, fever but no chills, uh patient is also experiencing muscle aches but no headaches no neck tenderness or no neck tightness, no dizziness no confusion. Um along with the chest pain patient is also experiencing palpitations and fluttering in her chest, uh but no pre-syncopal episodes. for past medical history patient history of hypertension for the past 10 years that's been well-controlled. Patient’s taking lisinopril for the hypertension 10 milligrams one time per day. And is diligent with her medication.

Uh for my physical exam, I found that the patient had jugular venous distension bilaterally, um when palpating the inferior lateral chest wall um midclavicular chest wall on the left side, I noticed the point of maximal impulse for the heart had been shifted laterally. Um upon auscultating, the uh both lungs, um I heard bilateral rales and wheezing um in both the front and back um and plus one pitting edema uh in the lower limbs below the knee. Her Pulses were pedal pulses were were bilateral strong and uh equal. Um for the patient’s labs or, I’m sorry for the patient’s vitals, the heart rate is 110, respiratory rate is 20. temperature of 98.6, blood pressure 130/90.

He also admits some palpitations and wheezing with exertion but denies any chest pain. He said resting resolves his symptoms and he is comfortable at rest. he denies any recent illness prior two weeks ago. His active medical conditions include hypertension for which he takes lisinopril 10 mg daily. He denies any prior hospitalizations, but surgical history includes a cardiac catheter one year. He had not received any results from it but when his recent symptoms began, he called the office and they told him they did not find anything and so they referred him here. he is married and lives with his spouse, is sexually active and is in a monogamous relationship. he notes he has a balanced diet and denies alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use. He has one cup of coffee every day, prior to two weeks ago he walked daily with a group which he considered a social activity for him as well and he would like to get back to doing that. he is also a sixth grade teacher. He had told me that his father died at the age of 59 from a myocardial infarction and his mother died suddenly at the age of 40. His physical exam showed no edema, negative Homans sign, nontender and equal sized calves. And a nontender chest with palpation. he has a systolic murmur and laterally displaced PMI. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I evaluated Chapman’s points, TART changes, and thoracic spine and did not find any osteopathic findings. He did not have any JVD or carotid bruits, his chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and his echo showed left ventricle asymmetric ejection fraction of 60. His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, tall R waves in the septal leads and left ventricular hypertrophy. His labs were all negative. From my findings, I believe he’s suffering from NYHA class 2 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I explained to him that I believed it had genetic cause. I recommended that we admit him to telemetry and consider consult with interventional cardiology for AICD placement and cardiothoracic surgery for septal myomectomy and alcohol injection. I also believe that we should discontinue his lisinopril and switch him to disopyramide. And keep his activity as tolerated.  Thank you.",,

Student 153,.mp3,Student 153.mp3,"So I just met with Leslie Palmer. She’s a 62 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. She presents to the emergency department for the chief complaint of shortness of breath and fatigue. This patient states that approximately six months ago she started experiencing these symptoms even while she is at rest. she admits to dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and wheezing. she also states that she’s gained 8 pounds within the past two weeks that she noticed that her lower extremities are swollen. she denies chest pain or any palpitations. three days ago she saw her PCP who did labs on her and called her today and referred her to the emergency department which is why she’s here. she also states that she’s been smoking one pack per day for the past 30 years um and then she also told me about her surgical history. so 12 years ago she had bypass surgery and then within the past five years she’s also had five stents. her most recent stent was placed one year ago at her left anterior descending coronary artery and her most recent echo which was also one year ago indicated that her left ventricular ejection fraction was at 40%. When I looked at her vitals and even when walking into the room she clearly looked tachypneic. she showed that there was, she had 22 breaths per minute and she was also hypotensive at 80/50. Her oxygen saturation at the time was 86% on room air. so on physical exam um the patient was leaning over and gasping for breath. Um I saw um when I was auscultating her four posts, I saw that she was tachycardic with a split S2 um but I did not hear any murmurs rubs or gallops. Um when I was auscultating her lungs I heard bibasilar rales and then when I was assessing her lower extremity uh I saw one plus pitting edema bilaterally. but her pulses were normal and equal bilaterally. when I was looking at her labs, she had elevated troponin and BNP. Um Her troponin was 0.04 while her BMP was at 4000. her chest x-ray indicated that she had cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema and her echo showed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% so if that is a 10% decrease uh from last year’s echo. when I was looking at her EKG the most prominent finding was that she had a left bundle branch block um indicative of that s2 split. Ah she had a normal sinus for them and her uh her heart what did have a left axis deviation, and a left ventricular hypertrophy voltage criteria. so based on her symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue um that’s been worsening over the past six months, based off her physical exam and all of her imaging I would say that she has ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. um she is class four for the New York standards of classification, um again her chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema so I will admit her. I believe that is the best course of action to admit her into the ICU and I’ve consulted interventional cardiologist uh for possible automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator and or a cardiac resynchronization therapy um at this time. And thank you so much for listening to my presentation.",,

Patient states that the symptoms began a couple week ago, and has progressively became worse over the last 2-3 days. Uh symptoms are exacerbated um with some exercise and only relieved by rest. Patient has not tried any umm, patient has not tried any other treatments besides rest is helpful when he like lays down. Yeah, medications currently taking, he’s currently taking lisinopril 10 mg. He is taking this for his diagnosis of hypertension. He is currently up to date on all immunizations. And only hospitalization um was a cardiac cath which was, um, which turned out to be normal about a year ago. Family medical history was normal on his mother’s side and on his father’s side, he, his father had passed away from a heart attack at the age of 59, myocardial infarction. Diet is balanced. Uh patient states that before symptoms occurred, he was walking daily, um caffeine intake was one cup a day, um he is employed as a 5th grade elementary school teacher where he does have insurance through them. Um He is sexually active with his wife. Um, when going over the review of systems, patient has presented with fatigue, palpitations, pre-syncope, and dyspnea. I went ahead and then performed the physical exam. Physical exam findings included uhm no jugular venous distension, he had a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur and with S4, uh the PMI was laterally displaced, uh patient presented with no edema in the lower extremities, and pulses were normal bilaterally. And lungs were clear on auscultation bilaterally. When looking over the tests that were ordered, the troponin level was at zero, which is normal, BNP was at 90 which is normal, uh x-ray showed cardiomegaly, it did not show pulmonary infiltrates. ECHO showed left ventricular asymmetry and a ejection fracture of 60%. EKG showed tall septal R waves and also met criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. And it was a sinus rhythm. Um it was tachycardic. Patient did have a pulse of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130 systolic over 90 diastolic. Um Oxygen saturation um in the room was 96%. Respiratory rate was at 16 breaths per minute and temperature 98.6 F. Uh based on the um diagnostic labs that were ordered and tests that were ordered, physical exam, and past medical history, I believe this patient had has familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Um I do suggest that we admit this patient to uh telemetry, and we stop the lisinopril, start him on 100mg of disopyramide um everyday by IV, um I also believe that we should refer the Mr. Palmer to interventional cardiologist where we, where we possibly can implant um AICD placement. I also believe that we should refer him to cardiothoracic surgery uh for alcohol injections and septal myectomy to um reduce the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.",,
